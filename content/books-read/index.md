I&#8217;ve been working hard to continually fill my mind with knowledge. Through the images I see, the words I read, and the way I think. This is a transformation that is taking a long time and I believe I will continue to work on throughout my life. As I find things that I consider essential to my own success I will share them here. These are not business or programs. They are books. Different from my [recommendations][1]Â which are found on this site. So check back in often. I try to read a chapter a day in whatever book I&#8217;m currently reading. So depending on the book it takes me shorter or longer to complete. After I&#8217;m done I&#8217;ll link to it here if I feel it&#8217;s worth it. I won&#8217;t go into a review of the book (or maybe I will at some point, I don&#8217;t know) as they are easy to find online. Take a look and I encourage you to click through and purchase these books for your own library.
