Yes you can get free bitcoins. I have hand picked multiple sites below that you can visit to get free bitcoins. So what are bitcoins? It&#8217;s pretty simple.

Bitcoins (abbreviated BTC) are a virtual, peer to peer, distributed currency.

What this means is that there is no central authority controlling you money. No banks, no government, nada. Your money can never be frozen and nobody can ever take your money away.

In addition, bitcoin uses an advanced cryptology that is even more secure than what most banks use!

Bitcoins also can help you stay anonymous. You can generate a new bitcoin address for every transaction and if you&#8217;re careful nobody will every be able to link the addresses with each other giving you a truly anonymous currency.

So when you earn free bitcoins you truly are earning free money that can be turned into real cash in your bank account.

Here are a couple useful links about bitcoins:

[Bitcoin][1] &#8211; The official site of the Bitcoin Project][1] [WeUseCoins][2] &#8211; A great site devoted to explaining and getting people started using bitcoins quick and easily. I highly suggest this site.

So if you followed the guide on [WeUseCoins][2] you should have a bitcoin wallet now. If you don&#8217;t I can highly recommend [CoinBase][3] as I use them and they are quick and easy to get setup. Now that you have your bitcoin address you&#8217;re ready to start earning free bitcoins. So here&#8217;s the list I was telling you about as well as how often you can go (if applicable) and get more coins.

Yes you can get free bitcoins. I have hand picked multiple sites below that you can visit to get free bitcoins. So what are bitcoins? It&#8217;s pretty simple.

Bitcoins (abbreviated BTC) are a virtual, peer to peer, distributed currency.

What this means is that there is no central authority controlling you money. No banks, no government, nada. Your money can never be frozen and nobody can ever take your money away.

In addition, bitcoin uses an advanced cryptology that is even more secure than what most banks use!

Bitcoins also can help you stay anonymous. You can generate a new bitcoin address for every transaction and if you&#8217;re careful nobody will every be able to link the addresses with each other giving you a truly anonymous currency.

So when you earn free bitcoins you truly are earning free money that can be turned into real cash in your bank account.

Here are a couple useful links about bitcoins:

Yes you can get free bitcoins. I have hand picked multiple sites below that you can visit to get free bitcoins. So what are bitcoins? It&#8217;s pretty simple.

Bitcoins (abbreviated BTC) are a virtual, peer to peer, distributed currency.

What this means is that there is no central authority controlling you money. No banks, no government, nada. Your money can never be frozen and nobody can ever take your money away.

In addition, bitcoin uses an advanced cryptology that is even more secure than what most banks use!

Bitcoins also can help you stay anonymous. You can generate a new bitcoin address for every transaction and if you&#8217;re careful nobody will every be able to link the addresses with each other giving you a truly anonymous currency.

So when you earn free bitcoins you truly are earning free money that can be turned into real cash in your bank account.

Here are a couple useful links about bitcoins:

Yes you can get free bitcoins. I have hand picked multiple sites below that you can visit to get free bitcoins. So what are bitcoins? It&#8217;s pretty simple.

Bitcoins (abbreviated BTC) are a virtual, peer to peer, distributed currency.

What this means is that there is no central authority controlling you money. No banks, no government, nada. Your money can never be frozen and nobody can ever take your money away.

In addition, bitcoin uses an advanced cryptology that is even more secure than what most banks use!

Bitcoins also can help you stay anonymous. You can generate a new bitcoin address for every transaction and if you&#8217;re careful nobody will every be able to link the addresses with each other giving you a truly anonymous currency.

So when you earn free bitcoins you truly are earning free money that can be turned into real cash in your bank account.

Here are a couple useful links about bitcoins:

[Bitcoin][1] &#8211; The official site of the Bitcoin Project][1] [WeUseCoins][2] &#8211; A great site devoted to explaining and getting people started using bitcoins quick and easily. I highly suggest this site.

Yes you can get free bitcoins. I have hand picked multiple sites below that you can visit to get free bitcoins. So what are bitcoins? It&#8217;s pretty simple.

Bitcoins (abbreviated BTC) are a virtual, peer to peer, distributed currency.

What this means is that there is no central authority controlling you money. No banks, no government, nada. Your money can never be frozen and nobody can ever take your money away.

In addition, bitcoin uses an advanced cryptology that is even more secure than what most banks use!

Bitcoins also can help you stay anonymous. You can generate a new bitcoin address for every transaction and if you&#8217;re careful nobody will every be able to link the addresses with each other giving you a truly anonymous currency.

So when you earn free bitcoins you truly are earning free money that can be turned into real cash in your bank account.

Here are a couple useful links about bitcoins:

[Bitcoin][1] &#8211; The official site of the Bitcoin Project][1] [WeUseCoins][2] &#8211; A great site devoted to explaining and getting people started using bitcoins quick and easily. I highly suggest this site.

Yes you can get free bitcoins. I have hand picked multiple sites below that you can visit to get free bitcoins. So what are bitcoins? It&#8217;s pretty simple.

Bitcoins (abbreviated BTC) are a virtual, peer to peer, distributed currency.

What this means is that there is no central authority controlling you money. No banks, no government, nada. Your money can never be frozen and nobody can ever take your money away.

In addition, bitcoin uses an advanced cryptology that is even more secure than what most banks use!

Bitcoins also can help you stay anonymous. You can generate a new bitcoin address for every transaction and if you&#8217;re careful nobody will every be able to link the addresses with each other giving you a truly anonymous currency.

So when you earn free bitcoins you truly are earning free money that can be turned into real cash in your bank account.

Here are a couple useful links about bitcoins:

Yes you can get free bitcoins. I have hand picked multiple sites below that you can visit to get free bitcoins. So what are bitcoins? It&#8217;s pretty simple.

Bitcoins (abbreviated BTC) are a virtual, peer to peer, distributed currency.

What this means is that there is no central authority controlling you money. No banks, no government, nada. Your money can never be frozen and nobody can ever take your money away.

In addition, bitcoin uses an advanced cryptology that is even more secure than what most banks use!

Bitcoins also can help you stay anonymous. You can generate a new bitcoin address for every transaction and if you&#8217;re careful nobody will every be able to link the addresses with each other giving you a truly anonymous currency.

So when you earn free bitcoins you truly are earning free money that can be turned into real cash in your bank account.

Here are a couple useful links about bitcoins:

Yes you can get free bitcoins. I have hand picked multiple sites below that you can visit to get free bitcoins. So what are bitcoins? It&#8217;s pretty simple.

Bitcoins (abbreviated BTC) are a virtual, peer to peer, distributed currency.

What this means is that there is no central authority controlling you money. No banks, no government, nada. Your money can never be frozen and nobody can ever take your money away.

In addition, bitcoin uses an advanced cryptology that is even more secure than what most banks use!

Bitcoins also can help you stay anonymous. You can generate a new bitcoin address for every transaction and if you&#8217;re careful nobody will every be able to link the addresses with each other giving you a truly anonymous currency.

So when you earn free bitcoins you truly are earning free money that can be turned into real cash in your bank account.

Here are a couple useful links about bitcoins:

[Bitcoin][1] &#8211; The official site of the Bitcoin Project][1] [WeUseCoins][2] &#8211; A great site devoted to explaining and getting people started using bitcoins quick and easily. I highly suggest this site.

So if you followed the guide on [WeUseCoins][2] you should have a bitcoin wallet now. If you don&#8217;t I can highly recommend [CoinBase][3] as I use them and they are quick and easy to get setup.

Yes you can get free bitcoins. I have hand picked multiple sites below that you can visit to get free bitcoins. So what are bitcoins? It&#8217;s pretty simple.

Bitcoins (abbreviated BTC) are a virtual, peer to peer, distributed currency.

What this means is that there is no central authority controlling you money. No banks, no government, nada. Your money can never be frozen and nobody can ever take your money away.

In addition, bitcoin uses an advanced cryptology that is even more secure than what most banks use!

Bitcoins also can help you stay anonymous. You can generate a new bitcoin address for every transaction and if you&#8217;re careful nobody will every be able to link the addresses with each other giving you a truly anonymous currency.

So when you earn free bitcoins you truly are earning free money that can be turned into real cash in your bank account.

Here are a couple useful links about bitcoins:

[Bitcoin][1] &#8211; The official site of the Bitcoin Project][1] [WeUseCoins][2] &#8211; A great site devoted to explaining and getting people started using bitcoins quick and easily. I highly suggest this site.

So if you followed the guide on [WeUseCoins][2] you should have a bitcoin wallet now. If you don&#8217;t I can highly recommend [CoinBase][3] as I use them and they are quick and easy to get setup.

Yes you can get free bitcoins. I have hand picked multiple sites below that you can visit to get free bitcoins. So what are bitcoins? It&#8217;s pretty simple.

Bitcoins (abbreviated BTC) are a virtual, peer to peer, distributed currency.

What this means is that there is no central authority controlling you money. No banks, no government, nada. Your money can never be frozen and nobody can ever take your money away.

In addition, bitcoin uses an advanced cryptology that is even more secure than what most banks use!

Bitcoins also can help you stay anonymous. You can generate a new bitcoin address for every transaction and if you&#8217;re careful nobody will every be able to link the addresses with each other giving you a truly anonymous currency.

So when you earn free bitcoins you truly are earning free money that can be turned into real cash in your bank account.

Here are a couple useful links about bitcoins:

[Bitcoin][1] &#8211; The official site of the Bitcoin Project][1] [WeUseCoins][2] &#8211; A great site devoted to explaining and getting people started using bitcoins quick and easily. I highly suggest this site.

So if you followed the guide on [WeUseCoins][2] you should have a bitcoin wallet now. If you don&#8217;t I can highly recommend [CoinBase][3] as I use them and they are quick and easy to get setup.

Yes you can get free bitcoins. I have hand picked multiple sites below that you can visit to get free bitcoins. So what are bitcoins? It&#8217;s pretty simple.

Bitcoins (abbreviated BTC) are a virtual, peer to peer, distributed currency.

What this means is that there is no central authority controlling you money. No banks, no government, nada. Your money can never be frozen and nobody can ever take your money away.

In addition, bitcoin uses an advanced cryptology that is even more secure than what most banks use!

Bitcoins also can help you stay anonymous. You can generate a new bitcoin address for every transaction and if you&#8217;re careful nobody will every be able to link the addresses with each other giving you a truly anonymous currency.

So when you earn free bitcoins you truly are earning free money that can be turned into real cash in your bank account.

Here are a couple useful links about bitcoins:

Yes you can get free bitcoins. I have hand picked multiple sites below that you can visit to get free bitcoins. So what are bitcoins? It&#8217;s pretty simple.

Bitcoins (abbreviated BTC) are a virtual, peer to peer, distributed currency.

What this means is that there is no central authority controlling you money. No banks, no government, nada. Your money can never be frozen and nobody can ever take your money away.

In addition, bitcoin uses an advanced cryptology that is even more secure than what most banks use!

Bitcoins also can help you stay anonymous. You can generate a new bitcoin address for every transaction and if you&#8217;re careful nobody will every be able to link the addresses with each other giving you a truly anonymous currency.

So when you earn free bitcoins you truly are earning free money that can be turned into real cash in your bank account.

Yes you can get free bitcoins. I have hand picked multiple sites below that you can visit to get free bitcoins. So what are bitcoins? It&#8217;s pretty simple.

Bitcoins (abbreviated BTC) are a virtual, peer to peer, distributed currency.

What this means is that there is no central authority controlling you money. No banks, no government, nada. Your money can never be frozen and nobody can ever take your money away.

In addition, bitcoin uses an advanced cryptology that is even more secure than what most banks use!

Bitcoins also can help you stay anonymous. You can generate a new bitcoin address for every transaction and if you&#8217;re careful nobody will every be able to link the addresses with each other giving you a truly anonymous currency.

So when you earn free bitcoins you truly are earning free money that can be turned into real cash in your bank account.

Yes you can get free bitcoins. I have hand picked multiple sites below that you can visit to get free bitcoins. So what are bitcoins? It&#8217;s pretty simple.

Bitcoins (abbreviated BTC) are a virtual, peer to peer, distributed currency.

What this means is that there is no central authority controlling you money. No banks, no government, nada. Your money can never be frozen and nobody can ever take your money away.

In addition, bitcoin uses an advanced cryptology that is even more secure than what most banks use!

Bitcoins also can help you stay anonymous. You can generate a new bitcoin address for every transaction and if you&#8217;re careful nobody will every be able to link the addresses with each other giving you a truly anonymous currency.

Yes you can get free bitcoins. I have hand picked multiple sites below that you can visit to get free bitcoins. So what are bitcoins? It&#8217;s pretty simple.

Bitcoins (abbreviated BTC) are a virtual, peer to peer, distributed currency.

What this means is that there is no central authority controlling you money. No banks, no government, nada. Your money can never be frozen and nobody can ever take your money away.

In addition, bitcoin uses an advanced cryptology that is even more secure than what most banks use!

Bitcoins also can help you stay anonymous. You can generate a new bitcoin address for every transaction and if you&#8217;re careful nobody will every be able to link the addresses with each other giving you a truly anonymous currency.

So when you earn free bitcoins you truly are earning free money that can be turned into real cash in your bank account.

Here are a couple useful links about bitcoins:

Yes you can get free bitcoins. I have hand picked multiple sites below that you can visit to get free bitcoins. So what are bitcoins? It&#8217;s pretty simple.

Bitcoins (abbreviated BTC) are a virtual, peer to peer, distributed currency.

What this means is that there is no central authority controlling you money. No banks, no government, nada. Your money can never be frozen and nobody can ever take your money away.

In addition, bitcoin uses an advanced cryptology that is even more secure than what most banks use!

Bitcoins also can help you stay anonymous. You can generate a new bitcoin address for every transaction and if you&#8217;re careful nobody will every be able to link the addresses with each other giving you a truly anonymous currency.

So when you earn free bitcoins you truly are earning free money that can be turned into real cash in your bank account.

Here are a couple useful links about bitcoins:
  
[Bitcoin][1] &#8211; The official site of the Bitcoin Project[_<img class="size-medium wp-image-1279 alignleft" alt="free bitcoins" src="http://sethaalexander.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bitcoin-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" />_

Here are a couple useful links about bitcoins:
  
[Bitcoin][1] &#8211; The official site of the Bitcoin Project][1] [WeUseCoins][2] &#8211; A great site devoted to explaining and getting people started using bitcoins quick and easily. I highly suggest this site.

So if you followed the guide on [WeUseCoins][2] you should have a bitcoin wallet now. If you don&#8217;t I can highly recommend [CoinBase][3] as I use them and they are quick and easy to get setup. Now that you have your bitcoin address you&#8217;re ready to start earning free bitcoins. So here&#8217;s the list I was telling you about as well as how often you can go (if applicable) and get more coins.

## Free Bitcoins Site List (Updated 05/03/13) Last payment received in green:

[Mining United][4] &#8211; This is not really a site to get free bitcoins per se. However, I have been utilizing their services and can say they have paid out multiple times to me already. Their site has more info. You need at least 0.05 bitcoins to start. **<span style="color: #008000;">0.1339</span>**

[CoinURL][5] &#8211; A URL shortening service where you earn bit coins when people click your links. I use CoinURL on all links on this page. It helps me earn a little (very little) on every click for the time I put in curating, updating, and maintaining this free bitcoins list.
  
[BitVisitor][6] &#8211; I use this site daily. Surf sites and get free bitcoins. I usually just leave it open in a tab and go about my business online. <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>0.0000656</strong></span> but varies.
