We have been in a recession that doesn&#8217;t appear to be getting any better, and it won&#8217;t for a considerable time until these congressmen stop arguing among themselves!

Those without jobs, people who can only find part-time work and others who hate their roles and are looking for a business opportunity, Multi Level Marketing is one of the finest opportunities today.

### Business Opportunity MLM Has Such a Bad Rap!

With a business opportunity MLM, once you have made a careful decision about which opportunity you want to join, you&#8217;ll pay an one-time buy in cost, then you can go off and build your business. You will be backed up by a powerful company, an upline that should be glad to help you start, and a great product you can promote with lots of help from the company.

A brick and mortar business is going to cost a good deal of capital to get started, including lease, vehicle costs, insurance, staff costs and one of the biggest costs is buying inventory.

Buying a franchise can be prohibitively expensive for most people, and that entails all of the above and paying the franchisor a large slice of your profits every month. As a business proposition, MLM is one of the least expensive to get into.

### But I Know Nothing about Managing a Business

The expenses of creating a position in a good MLM business will depend entirely on the business. Some start out extraordinarily low, others can cost thousands. Which business opportunity MLM you choose is completely up to you and your budget.

It will still cost considerably less than a brick and mortar business or a good franchise. Both of those sorts of business require big capital and ongoing costs such as rent, payroll, operating expenses, advertising, etc. If you are thinking about affiliate promotion, it&#8217;s not as straightforward as the so-called pros tell folks. Affiliate income can be really small and your life will be spent driving traffic to your websites, writing articles, and trying to get your internet site on page one of Google.

To earn large amounts of cash you&#8217;ll have to outsource a lot of the work, which involves coordinating with outsourcers and paying them. There aren&#8217;t really enough hours in a week to run more than about ten affiliate internet sites correctly without help.

### OK I&#8217;m Sold, Now What Do I Do?

O.K, if you have never been in MLM or internet marketing before, do this. Read everything you probably can about network marketing first. The wheels which will drive your business will be leads, good leads.

The toughest thing for a recent arrival to MLM is generating those leads. There are offer systems that will help you hugely to get leads, get established, and earn some money while you are learning.

Read, learn and digest all you can about the MLM business structure, and also compensation plans which can on occasion be very mystifying. This should take you at least a week of intense self-education on the internet.

### Which Business Opportunity MLM?

If you decide you have got the right stuff as they say, then you should start to look for your [business opportunity MLM][1]. There are thousands of them. New MLM business opportunities are popping up every day. Get yourself a big pad or make an Excel spreadsheet until you whittle your decision down to 3 or 4. Now spend as much time as you can gathering as much information about the company as possible. Down to financials and who the managing team is and if they&#8217;re stable, now go for it.
