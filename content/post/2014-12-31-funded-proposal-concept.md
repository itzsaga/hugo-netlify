Successful network marketers have found the great opportunities provided by effective affiliate marketing campaigns. Unfortunately many internet marketers tend to forget that it&#8217;s still critical to sell other products to maximize commissions.

By integrating relevant affiliate marketing campaigns into their businesses, people can greatly increase their chances of success. This kind of integration calls for a funded proposal concept to be understood.

The whole concept of self funding is still new. Not a lot of internet network marketers really understand how it works and thus can&#8217;t implement it very well. Online marketing sounds extremely easy because no previous experience needed.

It could be the most flexible marketing program there is. As with everything, there are a number of factors that must be taken into consideration.

It&#8217;s actually feasible to make multiple commissions from the same leads. By matching the two, successful network marketers will swear to the incontrovertible fact that they have gained extra streams of income. When you understand a funded proposal concept, you will be surprised how well this could work for you.

After you&#8217;ve been successful doing this, you&#8217;ll soon notice that paid advertising like pay-per-click traffic building is a pointless waste of money.

## The Funded Proposal Concept

There are certain factors you must use to try this the correct way. The first and probably the most important is to stay centered. After you start diverting your attention to other marketing methods, you become unfocused and can lose commissions. In doing that you are heading away from any real affiliate marketing possibilities.

The internet marketing campaign that you choose to complement your business is very important to your greatness in this industry.

Always select an internet marketing campaign that complements your business. There are numerous sources on the web today. There is a gigantic selection of products and information that have relevancy to an MLM offer. These offers complement your MLM funded proposal concept. You may then integrate those products and information though your existing affiliate marketing campaign.

The best way is to start by including your funded proposal on your sales page. This will simply start skyrocketing the opt in rate. Your sales page is a advantageous tool. On your thank you page go ahead and explain the advantages of the affiliate product you are offering, and how valuable it&#8217;s going to be. Also, go ahead and tell them how valuable it&#8217;s going to be to use it through your link.

Remember to include the affiliate link in your sales letter too.

If you choose you could always skip over the thank you page and take them straight to the promotional page. This has been found to be more effective for some. It makes the method a little more complex and is best used only after succeeding in the first step. Learn how you must make your destination page more interesting. Always try and keep your landing page interesting so it does not fail to draw people in.

### Another Funded Proposal Concept

Nonetheless if you are the conservative kind, then link up your blog and the landing page and request that customers leave comments.

You can also link to your Facebook Page or Twitter profile for them to contact you. The [funded proposal concept][1] has worked well.

Try it today and see money start streaming into your account.
