Take a quick internet marketing test.

See how you score. Here are two real world affiliate internet marketing success techniques. Which is more rewarding to you in the long run?

In the first, it takes a hundred clicks to make a sale. Each sale pays $100 in commissions. The refund rate is a low five percent. At $.80 per click, what will be the return on your primary $100 investment?

In the second marketing scenario, it similarly takes a hundred clicks to make a sale. Each sale offers $100 commission but also gives a once per month residual commission of $10. As shown, there&#8217;s a 5 order refund rate and the average length of the subscription is four months. Now, if you pay $.80 per click exactly as in the 1st example, how much will you make now for your $100 investment?

The answer for the first example is this: it costs you $80 to make one sale. So that means you made $20 but you should take off five percent for the refunds, leaving you with $19 net profit. $19 is a good ROI. In the second example you&#8217;ll still receive $19 in commissions for that initial sale, but you also receive $40 for those 4 monthly sales. So if you add the $19 to the $40 then you have $59 which means a $59 return on investment which is a far more advantageous outcome!

### Residual Income Streams, That Small Extra Goes a Ways

You can always tell an excellent affiliate&#8217;s marketing model. The first time they offer something like in the first example above, they are going to find a way to leverage that sale. A lot of them will offer a free report, a bonus, or a type of review simply as a strategy of getting your opt in information. They give value for worth and this is where the leverage comes in.

A focused opt-in list could be worth up to five dollars a month to the list owner. This is another one of the residual income streams for the marketer. The key is to supply an upsell later, which of course gives the chance to earn another commission.

The heavy hitters in the affiliate marketing business go one better than that, they focus on promoting their products which at first supply an one-time commission but go on to supply an upsell to something that creates  monthly residual income streams, such as a membership site.

So the key to the best affiliate marketing opportunities is not about the first commission, it&#8217;s about what follows later. Can you blame them? In the example above, it&#8217;s the difference between a $19 and $59 ROI.

### The Secret to Wealth is Multiple Residual Income Streams

The Nile is the longest river in the world.

You can see it and it&#8217;s two main tributaries from space. It&#8217;s that big. What you can not see is the Nile is essentially fed by THOUSANDS of individual streams and tributaries. Thousands.

Lots of small streams merging to form one massive, world-record breaking river.

Look at your affiliate marketing efforts in the same way, by creating multiple streams of income, you are creating a river of wealth. You need to begin by promoting numerous different products that have the benefit of making residual income streams. Stick to those and nothing else.

Eventually you&#8217;ll be able to sit back and enjoy that river of income. Imagine starting every month off with a growing amount in the bank without doing a thing! Isn&#8217;t that the idea anyway?

You are never really beginning over or beginning from zero and hoping beyond hope you sell something this month.
