Mark Hughes set up Herbalife in 1980 but sadly Mark met an early death just before he turned forty-five.

Through fantastic management Herbalife has kept on growing and has become one of the most respected businesses in the weight loss domain. Additionally, they have been a significant part of the health food industry now for over 30 years.

Herbs, vitamins, pre-packaged food, Herbalife weight loss products, protein shakes, and protein bars are among the many products the company sells either by affiliates or distributors. It is a MLM business.

If being an affiliate or licensed dealer interests you, get in touch with a local distributor to sell Herbalife products at wholesale or retail.

## Herbalife Review: The Products in Summary

Herbalife&#8217;s products include pre-packed foods that are a part of their weight loss plan, and other healthy products like vitamins, protein bars and mixes for shakes. All the products are distributed through a MLM system. By contacting a local distributor you can get their products or become a distributor yourself.

### Herbalife Review: The Business

I cannot cover every way to build an Herbalife business in this Herbalife review. However, an Herbalife business that&#8217;s profitable can be established in several ways. You can sell the retail and wholesale products but if you want to earn more, you should recruit others to sell those products as well. You make a small percentage off what they sell.

As with any MLM business the way to earn money passively from other distributors is to build a large network.

You and your team can then either retail of wholesale products. Signing up a large downline of successful distributors is the secret to success. You can earn a small commission for every one of your team member&#8217;s sales and many small commissions can add up fast.

The basic steps to starting as a Herbalife distributor is to network with others, offer Herbalife products to them as a solution to their health or weight management Problems, and then follow up to sign them up either as a consumer or a part of your team. Like any offline MLM business the key is to network with tons of people and get leads.

The final thought is Herbalife is a corporation which has been in business for quite a while. They are a steady universal business that profits over a billion dollars in sales annually.

A few affiliates are earning in the six figures and others are making a cosy part time wage. A great deal will not make enough to compensate for business costs.

### Herbalife Review: How to Succeed

Take this key point from this [Herbalife review][1]. **The difference is marketing**. Like any business, marketing is what fuels sales of goods and services and building a money making Herbalife business is not an exception.

You need to master sales and selling if you really want to make serious cash in any home based business.

One of the best things to do before signing up for any MLM company is to take a look at the best marketing options available to you. A good internet based attraction promotion technique has set many on the road to fast profit. Then you may dig into other options such as paid advertising.
