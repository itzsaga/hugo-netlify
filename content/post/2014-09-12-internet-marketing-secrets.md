No this is not about how to pick up Women or how to pick up Men. Although the same mind set goes into designing a marketing campaign, which of course includes the following internet marketing secrets. As with any commercial or advertisement, marketing is the method with which to get the message to the consumer. As we have discussed in other articles, marketing is a system of putting knowledge to work in an advertising format that attracts potential customers through building an interest and desire that will compel them to buy.

If youâ€™ve had experience with any type of marketing, then you understand that the basic idea is to create an attraction through identifying or creating a need. The next step is to create value and then to paint a picture on how life is less fulfilling without the product or service. Theses are two of the many internet marketing secrets that are used for all marketing endeavors, meaning both on and off of the internet. In fact, landing pages are where and how the internet marketer collects their list of potential buyers. However, the marketing secret is to use language, on a given landing page, that creates the need and the visualization of what life would be like without the given product or service.

### Internet Marketing Secrets: Make a Compelling Statement

This is accomplished by focusing the message on what the customer is looking for, (the need or want), and building value around the benefits experienced through having the product or using the service offered. Customer reviews are a great way to accomplish this in addition to testimonials. These are the principle aspects for creating attention, interest, desire, and finally action. The first three make up the attraction factor while the last one, action, adds to the traffic generation. This because without the first three there will be no action taken, i.e. site visitation.
  
This is also the sole purpose of a landing page. This is where the internet marketer captures the attention of the prospect and begins to build desire through interesting and compelling statements that create further interest and desire in the product or service offered.

### Internet Marketing Secrets: Traffic Generation

Traffic or visitors to a website are how online businesses earn money. Without customers, internet marketers would not sell anything. Consequently, we find that one of the biggest internet marketing secrets is how to obtain traffic/lead generation. This is because there are a few different methods to do this that actually work and are realistic in their outcomes.

One is to advertise anywhere and everywhere you can. This means using the internet and printed materials. It is wise to utilize all methods available to reach potential buyers. This means using free and paid classified posting boards, forums, email, and so on. Part of this process with respect to the internet is search engine optimization. When done correctly, this drives traffic to a given website. All of these aspects discussed here are applicable to marketing overall with one exception, which is search engine optimization.
