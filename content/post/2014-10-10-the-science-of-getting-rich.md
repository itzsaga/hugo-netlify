You acquire what you own because of doing things by a variety of means and the ones that are successful are likely to stick to those reasons and apply them to other endeavors and keep growing rich. People who&#8217;ve not worked out the way to use these techniques &#8211; and it doesn&#8217;t matter how well they perform or how dedicated to their obligations they happen to be, they may never become successful. Wallace Wattles declares in this book that anyone that can follow this formula could definitely grow rich.

### So where is This Century-Old Secret?

Being conscious of the correct way to go about getting rich is paramount and the part that is made public by Mr. Wattles, is in your head. The basic beliefs are rather like Steve Pavlina&#8217;s concepts in his The Law of Attraction. You are in command over exactly what you do, so for everyone who is continually screwing up and getting things wrong, it&#8217;s time to face the reasons explaining why. The causes of an absence of success happen to be within your own unconscious mind. Nonetheless those people that are terribly successful may be seen as being born with this power of effective thinking and they appear to grow into entrepreneurs naturally. The Science of Growing Rich was created in order that everybody could get a positive mind-set, a positive attitude and carry that attitude out into their daily lives to win gigantic success.

### The Power of Human Will

Your will is why you choose to do things, and why you do not do things as well . Will is why a large amount of folk leap out of bed before the alarm goes off, whereas others go back to s1eep and dedicate their entire lives being consistently behind. The first kind are full of enthusiasm and expectancies for their day and the second potentially are thinking adversely, unless they&#8217;ve already been handed lots of money or won the lotto, those individuals do not end up being rich.
