I firmly believe that if you are not personally _motivated_ to succeed you never will. However, motivation comes from many sources. Some people are <u>motivated</u> by money. Some people are motivated by notoriety and being known as successful. Some people are motivated by necessity, it&#8217;s do or die almost literally. Some people are motivated just because people have told them they can&#8217;t do it. Then there are some people motivated by knowing they can help people. These are the people who are successful in network marketing businesses.

Why?

Because those who want to help people are the leaders. Yes along the way a lot can be achieved. However, in the end what makes a truly successful network marketer is helping others replicate what you have done in your business. Making others successful makes you successful. Your own success and leadership is what motivates your team to follow you. They will follow you when you make product recommendations, follow you when you join a new business, and follow you to success. You wil motivate your team to in turn motivate their team. You will turn your team into leaders and they will turn their teams into leaders. We all know replication is key in this business and replicating leaders is even more key! As long as you have a driving force in side you to do this you will make it.

You can see some things that I use to get personally motivated right [here][1] on my blog.

So ask yourself if you are not as successful as you want to be, what am I motivated by?
