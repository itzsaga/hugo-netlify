Even though it is not a free platform, the professional manner of this platform is what makes it more popular. And that is the reason why a lot of online business entrepreneurs are using _WordPress_. As a consequence of that, several tools have been released in the market today by which people can enhance the prospects of their <u>WordPress</u> blogs, and _SEOPressor_ is one such tool. Being a new entrant into this genre, we felt it apt to check out <u>SEOPressor</u> and find out if it is really worth all the talk that is going on about it.

What we found out, after testing the product for both performance and efficiency, is that this is a product that’s well worth all the investment made in it. In any case, people are always looking out for the best possible search engine optimization for their business website, and the fact of the matter is that WordPress SEO cannot get any better than what SEOPressor can provide. If used correctly, SEOPressor won’t just bring a WordPress website to the top page of search engines but it will also bring it to the top of the top page. Results can be expected to figure within the top 3 on the first page.

Here we shall take a look at why SEOPressor can achieve that. It’s a fact that this is one SEO tool that works in a very different way from other similar products. Let us tackle these differences one after the other.<!--more-->

**The Analysis**

SEOPressor depends on a factor known as the SEO Score for calculating the worthiness of a particular website. What it will do is it will take some parameters into account and decide whether a particular website will rank well on search engines or not. This score is a very unique aspect of SEOPressor and the best thing about it is that its results correspond exactly with what a superlative tool such as Google Analytics will show you.

**The Suggestions**

SEOPressor almost dissects your WordPress website and tells you things about it—innermost details that if you pay attention to could improve the prospects of your website to an amazing degree. It will tell you, for instance, if your keyword is placed in the right position or not, and what a better position would be. It will tell you about what kind of format you need to use for your titles—H1, H2 or H3—and it will tell you how the graphics on your website are influencing the prospects of your website. SEOPressor doesn’t just tell you about your mistakes, but it will also tell you the solutions and will offer to do them for you as well. This is one software application that allows you to sit back and relax as it continuously keeps monitoring your website and tells you exactly what you need to do in order to bring up the ranking of your website.

**The Newness Factor**

This is one thing to consider. The product is quite new, and even WordPress is continuously changing, which makes it definitely a good thing to be new. For instance, SEOPressor is already compatible with the new WordPress 3.0, something that most other WordPress search engine optimization tools on the Internet are still trying to come to grips with.

**The Convenience**

This is what made this tool a big hit in its initial days. Even now, after several modifications, the plug-in remains just as easy as it was earlier. There’s nothing you need to install; it is just a simple download that you have to do. Despite the program itself being very complex, you don’t need to be a technical whiz to figure it out. The developers have tried to keep their program as much self-driving as possible.

**The Secret Algorithm**

Since its release, people have wondered about how the results of SEOPressor can match so perfectly with the results of Google Analytics. Only recently was it announced that SEOPressor uses a secret algorithm that works in the very manner that the Google search engine works to rank its websites. Using this particular algorithm, it is almost a no-brainer for SEOPressor to understand what it actually takes for a website to shoot right up the rung on the Google search pile. This is the one thing that has made SEOPressor so famous.

**The Developer’s Reputation**

SEOPressor has been designed and developed by Daniel Tan, who is one of the greatest search engine optimization gurus in the world today. He has developed successful programs in the past such as the Backlinks Syndication System, the Rank Mover, the Ultimate RSS Joiner and the Press Release Cash Cow. All of these have been quite commended in the online world, which is the same thing that is happening with SEOPressor currently.
