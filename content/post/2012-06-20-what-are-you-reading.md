As none of us are born experts we must learn from others. If you are not _reading_ at least one business book a month you are shortchanging yourself and your success. There is a reason that every successful businessman and woman recommend the same books. They not only are great sources of knowledge but also inspire and embed certain mindset traits into their readers when read properly and understood.

With technological advances <u>reading</u> is easier than ever. Snag a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051QVESA?ie=UTF8&tag=itzsagsxang08-20&linkCode=shr&camp=213733&creative=393177&creativeASIN=B0051QVESA&ref_=nav_sap_k6b">Kindle</a> for $79 USD and one can start reading without carrying with them more than what a cup of coffee weighs. If you don not want to buy an e-reader such as the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051QVESA?ie=UTF8&tag=itzsagsxang08-20&linkCode=shr&camp=213733&creative=393177&creativeASIN=B0051QVESA&ref_=nav_sap_k6b">Kindle</a> you get get the app for free on your phone and computer and read that way. I do most of my reading through the free app on my phone as my phone has such a large screen.

Take this passage from <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1612930298?ie=UTF8&tag=itzsagsxang08-20&linkCode=shr&camp=213733&creative=393185&creativeASIN=1612930298&keywords=think%20and%20grow%20rich&qid=1340186447&ref_=sr_1_1&sr=8-1"><em>Think and Grow Rich</em></a> (which I&#8217;m currently reading) by Napolean Hill:

&#8220;Every human being who reaches the age of understanding of the purpose of money, wishes for it. _Wishing_ will not bring riches. But _desiring_ riches with a state of mind that becomes an obsession, then planning definite ways and means to acquire riches, and backing those plans with persistence which _does not recognize failure_, will bring riches.

The method by which DESIRE for riches can be transmuted into its financial equivalent, consists of six definite, practical steps, viz:

First. Fix in your mind the _exact_ amount of money you desire. It is not sufficient merely to say “I want plenty of money.” Be definite as to the amount. (There is a psychological reason for definiteness which will be described in a subsequent chapter).

Second. Determine exactly what you intend to give in return for the money you desire. (There is no such reality as “something for nothing.)

Third. Establish a definite date when you intend to _possess_ the money you desire.

Fourth. Create a definite plan for carrying out your desire, and begin _at once_, whether you are ready or not, to put this plan into _action_.

Fifth. Write out a clear, concise statement of the of money you intend to acquire, name the time limit for its acquisition, state what you intend to give in return for the money, and describe clearly the plan through which you intend to accumulate it.

Sixth. Read your written statement aloud, twice daily, once just before retiring at night, and once after arising in the morning. AS YOU READ—SEE AND FEEL AND BELIEVE YOURSELF ALREADY IN POSSESSION OF THE MONEY.&#8221;

This definitely is aimed at those looking for financial success but at the core of it is all about a mindset. This mindset is developed through READING and SPEAKING the written statement that you write. This in turn burns it into your core being and in time turns you into the person who will achieve the goal set. If your mentors have not provided you with at least six books that they recommend reading then I say they are not really your mentors. They are just mere figureheads looking to make money off of you and not with you.

I want to recommend a few books to add to your reading list. If you have already read them let me know in the comments what you thought about them. If you have not read them yet, do. I guarantee reading these books will add to your life and your business successes. I&#8217;m providing direct links to Amazon <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051QVESA?ie=UTF8&tag=itzsagsxang08-20&linkCode=shr&camp=213733&creative=393177&creativeASIN=B0051QVESA&ref_=nav_sap_k6b">Kindle</a> Editions for purchase of these books so you can start reading them immediately. Do not put off til tomorrow what you can do today.

I have also found that a subscription to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.success.com/">Success</a> magazine is invaluable. I have multiple magazine subscriptions but there is only one that I am reading consistently and that is <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.success.com/">Success</a>. They also provide a digital edition for reading on your computer, iPad or iPhone for under $20 per year <a rel="nofollow" href="https://services.success.com/subscribe/subscriptions/digital/?subkey=9SUB&refid=#subscribe">here</a>.

So now get to reading. If there is something you have read or are reading now that you think I should add to this list let me know in the comments. I look forward to reading your comments and suggestions.
