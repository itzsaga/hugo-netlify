Have you been considering getting into the MLM business but comfused by MLM compensation plans? A lot of folks are because it is an overwhelming enterprise and you can make lots of cash. But it is important that you glance at the company&#8217;s compensation plans before making a call, as many of these plans differ.

Let us assume you have recently done some homework about the company you are considering, and they look solid. You poked around online and found both good and bad info about the company.

It appeared that all the complaints came from pissed off distributors, but hey, that&#8217;s due to the fact they didn&#8217;t work hard enough to build their team.

You have to work at any kind of job to be a success don&#8217;t you? That will not be an issue, you know lots of people.

But what about the MLM compensation plans the companies are providing? Did you take the time to look and understand them? If you&#8217;re still uncertain, please do not think you&#8217;re stupid as, some are complicated.

Here&#8217;s the thing. Most MLM compensation plans aren&#8217;t hard to figure out if you go over it a couple of times and actually pretend, on paper, you are creating a business.

In fact, this is often a healthy exercise to do so that you can outline a nice plan of action and one or two goals.

In each business there are terms unique to that business. It&#8217;s not critical to understand what a matrix system, a binary system, or an Australian one up system is. It&#8217;s not important.

The issue is are people making the sort of money that you would like to make in the specific program? The truth of the matter is you can, you just have to stand by and get ready to build your business.

### MLM Compensation Plans Sign Up Bonuses

One thing to have a look at is if the company pays any sort of sign up bonus.

For example, it may cost $150 to join and the company may pay out a $20 sign up bonus.

This is good, although not that good if you compare it with a company that costs the same to join but pays out a solid $50 per sign up.

It&#8217;s a fact that without selling you and your team are going to run out of people to approach with your opportunity, so selling is going to become necessary. Advertising isn&#8217;t free. Thus the bigger the bonuses the company offers the more cash you can put away for the time you&#8217;ll need it to pay for promoting and advertising.

But if you do not make any cash signing people up, how can you afford to continue to market and promote your business?

You almost certainly have heard of heavy hitters, these are the guys that join up, are massively successful, and build their companies fast. Are you going to get paid for their efforts as well or are you going to have to balance the legs of your binary plan by finding an equally hard hitter?

Bottom line: Select two or three companies you are considering and compare their [MLM compensation plans][1] side by side as if you are truly creating a business. Pencil out the number and determine which is the best MLM compensation plan that matches the income levels you wish to achieve.
