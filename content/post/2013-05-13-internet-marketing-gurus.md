The problem is, how can you be sure your &#8220;guru&#8221; truly knows what they&#8217;re talking about. In this age of the internet fake reviews, fake earnings screenshots, and other misleading tactics while illegal are still used by fakes. One of the reasons I have this online marketing blog is to help YOU in your decisions on who to follow, who&#8217;s legit, and ways to take the gurus right out of the equation and become your own boss. You can even end up being called one of the marketing gurus if you work hard and take action.

## Internet Marketing Gurus Exposed

One of the main problems I&#8217;ve seen with internet gurus is they don&#8217;t make their money doing the things that they sell you. So what I&#8217;m saying is they will sell you a course on how to make money online. However, this course is not what they are currently doing to make money. The internet marketing gurus are making their money selling you the product. Not by doing what the product instructs. Now this is not all the internet marketing gurus are doing but I&#8217;ve noticed that&#8217;s what a lot of them are. Not only is it deceptive but it&#8217;s not right or fair to those who can&#8217;t see through the BS.

This is one of the main reasons I endorse very few, if any at a certain point in time, programs that claim they are blueprints to exactly how the seller is making money online. Especially affiliate marketing gurus. They make their money using their reputation to sell others products. Now, I don&#8217;t think there is anything wrong with affiliate marketing. I do it. However, I feel to make a living off of any type of affiliate marketing takes a more established persona in this internet marketing game. That or a large budget.

## Are There Any Internet Marketing Gurus I Can Trust?

I truly think there are many reputable &#8220;gurus&#8221; online. So many I care not to mention them all. No matter what level I get to in my online business I&#8217;ll never call myself a &#8220;guru.&#8221; Maybe that&#8217;s because I&#8217;ll always be learning. If I&#8217;m learning then I have to be learning from someone. So I will never worry myself with being one of the top internet marketing gurus in my lifetime. I will however, always mentor and coach those who ask and are willing to take action. People who will actually put their words into action and make things happen.

One thing I will also always do is only refer people to programs, systems, and products that I actually use. One of the best being these [free weekly marketing webinars][1] hosted only by 6 and 7 figure earners in the industry. If you truly want to get your business jump started in the right direction and learn how to generate 20+ leads per day, to have an endless supply of buyers coming to you then join me at the [Business Builder Academy][2]. If you truly are serious about making a change in your life **SHOW ME **by taking the first step and joining me at the academy. I&#8217;ll see you on the other side.
