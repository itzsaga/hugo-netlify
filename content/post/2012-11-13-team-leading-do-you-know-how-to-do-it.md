You are expected not only to lead but to show your team how to be successful in the very competitive industry that is network marketing. The team you have is relying on you to show them where to go and how to get there. This all in the hope that you will lead them to success.

When you are _team leading_, you must be extremely confident. This is because the team you are leading is looking up to you and can feel your confidence in your abilities. So the question is, are you really <u>team leading</u> towards success, or pushing them over the cliff of failure?

While team leading, you should be contributing to some part of the development and improvement of your team&#8217;s network marketing businesses. They are allowing you to lead them with the belief that your team leading ability is backed up by the skills that a great leader should have. To ensure this keep track of your team and their progress. If they are not progressing with their businesses something is wrong and you need to reevaluate your team leading strategies.

Outside of looking at profits and losses of the people downline of you, the happiness of your members is an amazing indicator of your team leading ability and how successful it is. Are they satisfied with the methods you use in team leading, and the marketing methods you choose? Satisfied and happy followers will be very appreciative and grateful of the way you are leading the team, while unhappy and dissatisfied followers will have many complaints and may even look for other leaders to follow and leave your team thinking they have found a more beneficial fit.<!--more-->

Team leading in the network marketing industry is a challenge and nobody is perfect, do not think you are that exception to the rule because you may be crushed when you fall the first time. Always look at the amount that you are helping your team or not. Review what you are doing, what is working and what isn&#8217;t. If it isn&#8217;t working remove it and replace it with something else. If you notice that your team leading skills are truly working and your team is growing towards great success do not stop motivating and showing your team the way. They will thank you for it and be your greatest marketing tool of all! Do not forget that a small incentive or compliment can go a long way as well. The success of your team is also your success so by investing in them you are investing in yourself too.
