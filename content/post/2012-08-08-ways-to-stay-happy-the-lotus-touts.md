It is definitely worth sharing. Enjoy.

ONE. Give people more than they expect and do it cheerfully.

TWO. Marry a man/woman you love to talk to. As you get older, their conversational skills will be as important as any other.

THREE. Don&#8217;t believe all you hear, spend all you have or sleep all you want.

FOUR. When you say, &#8216;I love you,&#8217; mean it.

FIVE. When you say, &#8216;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8217; look the person in the eye.

SIX. Be engaged at least six months before you get married.

SEVEN. Believe in love at first sight.

EIGHT. Never laugh at anyone&#8217;s dreams. People who don&#8217;t have dreams don&#8217;t have much.

NINE&#8230; Love deeply and passionately. You might get hurt but it&#8217;s the only way to live life completely.

TEN.. In disagreements, fight fairly. No name calling.

ELEVEN. Don&#8217;t judge people by their relatives.

TWELVE. Talk slowly but think quickly.

THIRTEEN. When someone asks you a question you don&#8217;t want to answer, smile and ask, &#8216;Why do you want to know?&#8217;

FOURTEEN. Remember that great love and great achievements involve great risk.

FIFTEEN. Say &#8216;bless you&#8217; when you hear someone sneeze.

SIXTEEN. When you lose, don&#8217;t lose the lesson.

SEVENTEEN. Remember the three R&#8217;s: Respect for self; Respect for others; and Responsibility for all your actions.

EIGHTEEN. Don&#8217;t let a little dispute injure a great friendship.

NINETEEN. When you realize you&#8217;ve made a mistake, take immediate steps to correct it.

TWENTY. Smile when picking up the phone. The caller will hear it in your voice.

TWENTY- ONE. Spend some time alone.

Enjoy these _lotus touts_ and put them into action. I had never heard of <u>lotus touts</u> but after reading these I think I should have a long time ago!
