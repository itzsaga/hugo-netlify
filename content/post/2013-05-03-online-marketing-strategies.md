That does not mean there aren&#8217;t some tactics that have stood the test of time. However, what internet strategy you choose will definitely depend on your ultimate goal and the business you&#8217;re in. One thing I will not do is generalize and recommend a few as the best online marketing strategies. Neither will I recommend brand new internet marketing strategies that I have not tried and tested. The internet is organic and yes it is true if you figure out something or get in on a hot trend right away it can be VERY fruitful. Sometimes these trends last and sometimes they&#8217;re gone so quick you are truly still lost after it&#8217;s gone. Even if you experienced success for a short period of time.

## What are some of the most used online marketing strategies at the writing of this?

Some of the most popular strategies for marketing online right now are:

  * <span style="line-height: 13px;">SEO (search engine optimization)</span>
  * Email marketing
  * Web design, development, and promotion
  * Niche marketing with affiliate, reseller, and associate programs
  * Press releases
  * Blogging
  * Contests and giveaways via your website
  * Social media marketing
  * PPC (pay per click)

Now this is by no means all online marketing strategies available right now but some that I feel are the most common and most effective. Master any one of these and I believe you will have a very successful online career. Master multiple of them and you can literally write your own paychecks because of the amount of income you will be able to generate with the knowledge you have.

As long as you take ACTION. Always remember this favorite quote I&#8217;ve heard from many successful internet marketers, &#8220;**MONEY LOVES SPEED!**&#8221; Learn something, implement it!

One of the main things I focus on in my business online is helping others. I truly believe is I can help others succeed then I myself will succeed. There&#8217;s something about being a leader and watching your students go from novice, to intermediate, to masters of this internet marketing game. I truly feel it&#8217;s a game too. Since the internet is a system you can learn to work the system by using specific online marketing strategies well and make a great living doing it too. To get in on my coaching check out my [Business Builder Academy][1].

Now I&#8217;ll give you something for free, yes you read that right, **FREE**. If you want to learn from 6 and 7 figure earners weekly then you have to get in on these webinars. These [Free Training Webinars][2]Â cover topics such as: Social Networking (Facebook marketing, Twitter marketing, Linkedin marketing, Meet-Up groups); Content Marketing (keyword research, blogging, content/article marketing, video marketing); Paid Marketing (PayPerClick marketing, YouTube PayPerClick, Facebook PayPerClick, banner advertising, ezine/solo ads); Prospecting (get leads today, follow-up closing, prospecting strangers); and Additional Strategies (free classifieds, forum marketing, resume database advertising, listbuilders) to name a few.
