### So what will you learn in this Rippln review?

I will tell you all about this new phenomenom that is sweeping the internet right now called Rippln in thie Rippln review. It is currently in a prelaunch mode and I can only share _some_ information as I have signed a NDA (non disclosure agreement) with Rippln. However, I have five (yes only 5) invites that I can use to give others a behind the scenes look at what Rippln is and how it&#8217;s going to change the marketplace. You will also be required to sign a NDA but trust me, it&#8217;s worth it!

Mobile apps are basically taking over the world right now. Rippln is a new mobile app. Almost every company has their own app now to interact directly with their customers. People can even create their own apps relatively easily now with free online tools.

In addition, social media has already taken over most of our lives. We use it daily to interact, stay in touch with, and update our friends, family, coworkers and others. We use it for business and pleasure. There is no denying that social media has become an integral part of society today. It&#8217;s just a way of life right now.

### Rippln Review: Cashing in on the Social Media and Mobile App crazes

Imagine this&#8230;

What if you were one of the first in on these mobile apps and social media platforms and had a way of cashing in on them?

Facebook &#8211; 1+ billion active users
  
Twitter &#8211; 200+ million active users
  
LinkedIn &#8211; 200+ million active users
  
Angry Birds &#8211; 200+ million active users
  
InstaGram &#8211; 90+ million active users
  
Pinterest &#8211; 85+ million active users
  
Google+ &#8211; 65+ million active users

If you could have been paid a tiny percentage just for sharing the app and platform to others and getting them to use it for free. This is the basis of Rippln and what I want you to get from this Rippln review. Think about it. You can truly get paid to do what you are already doing on a daily basis. That&#8217;s using mobile apps and social media to interact with people in your sphere of influence.

### Rippln Review: What is Rippln?

From the official [Rippln site][1]:

> The Rippln app brings long-overdue transparency to the social engagement business and has created a new monetary model for &#8220;eyeball acquisition&#8221;. With Rippln, people will finally be able to see the impact of their social graph on the market and have the chance to profit from it. This transparency is important because in recent years huge companies and apps have relied on users&#8217; social influence to grow their companies by one person telling another person. Until Rippln, that influence had never been disclosed, although it is clearly valuable. Once users are put into the profit equation, there may be no going back.

That&#8217;s about all I can tell you about that in this Rippln review although I know more.

### Rippln Review: Compensation Plan

I can&#8217;t disclose about the compensation plan in this Rippln review as I have signed a NDA. I can tell you though that it&#8217;s a **MONSTER** and has some game changing features that are really exciting.

The best part about this prelaunch though is you can get all the same info I have if you get an invite code. You know what, I have 5 invite codes! Yes 5, so be quick and I can get you one. Just e-mail me at [seth@sethaalexander.com][2] with your full name, e-mail address and mobile phone number including country code (if you&#8217;re in the US it&#8217;s just 1-XXX-XXX-XXXX) and I can get your invite out to you. I have only received one automated text from the system with my invite code and I believe they&#8217;re using that as a form of verification.

Here&#8217;s a quick 2:24 video that explains as much as it can without you signing the NDA.



Any questions leave them in the comments. I hope you enjoyed this Rippln review and choose to join me in this fun game!
