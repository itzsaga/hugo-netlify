By the end of their third month in business, 70% or more pull the plug and quit, often in worse financial shape than when they started.

It&#8217;s disheartening but it&#8217;s true. The nastiest of it is, it just doesn&#8217;t have to be like that. The most important difference between success and failure in network marketing often is simply not finding a useful automated network marketing system that can do lots of the work and ease a lot of the burden.

### A Tool and a System are not the same

Many new network marketing business owners confuse tools with systems, and this may be an expensive mistake. They suspect that tools are a marketing system, but that just isn&#8217;t true.

A good network marketing system will employ several different tools, but any tool will be absolutely pointless unless it is part of a totally integrated series of processes which are engineered to achieve a measurable result.

Your company may have gone through the expense of making a DVD which was engineered to generate interest in your product or opportunity.

Truthfully though these DVDs are only a tool, and one bit of the process of presentation and sales, it is a step in a series of a system of processes.

A webinar event hosted by heavy hitters in the business is great as a sponsoring tool. It will be fully pointless when offered on its own and not part of a sequence of steps which should be taken including registration and gathering of prospects&#8217; info for follow-up.

### Complete Network Marketing System Example

A system is a collection of uninterrupted steps designed to bring about a required result. A good network marketing system for lead generation, for example, may include a dozen steps, and if lead generation is being done online, the following steps might be taken:

A market research tool will be used to choose a target market, that has an interest in, or a need for your produce. As an example this target market might be chubby people.

Use search engine keyword research tools to pinpoint the actual words, phrases and idioms used by the chosen niche when in the market for your type of product, service or opportunity. E.g, &#8220;part-time Internet jobs&#8221;

Then you will use the tool to discover how much competition there is for those keywords, this particular tool will measure how many sites, blog posts, articles and probably adverts there are competing for those keywords.

The very next step will be to write articles for your internet site or blog and for submission to article directories.

Articles should be submitted to article directory websites or submitted to services that will allocate the articles to many article directory websites immediately.

Promote the article by pinging the url, social bookmarking and securing back links.

Notice the complete &#8220;network marketing system&#8221; is a collection of processes designed to produce a specific result.

In this situation, to get a new webpage to rank well on the search engines for keywords used by your target audience. This will end in a wave of carefully targeted traffic to your web site&#8230;

Where you might have yet another series of proved processes built to catch the interest of your new potential prospect and compel them to opt-in to get additional info.

## Network Marketing System A Turnkey Approach

One of the handiest ways to take your business to the next level is to find and use fully integrated network marketing system proven to provide the result you&#8217;re looking for.

But make sure you aren&#8217;t only making an investment in yet another tool without a system for using the tool efficiently.
