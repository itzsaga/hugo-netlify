### Surveyed MLM Network Marketing Lead

Most MLM network marketing lead generation companies and brokers can supply you with as many MLM leads as you and your team can handle. Just contact them and let them know what you are looking for and how much are willing to spend. Do a quick search and you&#8217;ll find you can get a MLM network marketing lead for pennies and leads for much much more. Price differences are determined by the age of the leads, quality of the lead source and how many times the leads will be resold. Type of information provided also plays a part.

It costs a lot of money to generate top quality business opportunity seeker leads. $12 to $25 or more per lead is not uncommon and the cost continues to rise. With up to twenty-five dollars invested, most brokers will sell a fresh lead for $5 or more a half dozen times. Then resell that same &#8220;aged&#8221; lead for $1 or more another dozen times. In fact, what most people don&#8217;t realize is there are only three or four major lead brokers online. The brokers sell to other brokers who then sell to the end consumer.

So while you might be all excited about paying big bucks for a &#8220;company specific, area code, exclusive to you&#8221; lead &#8211; there may be a half dozen other brokers selling that same exclusive lead as well.

If you are really brave or are really committed, you can start your own list through MLM network marketing lead generation. First things first. You need a lead capture page or splash page designed. Or perhaps one came with your opportunity. But you need an opt-in page one way or the other. Once set up, the next step is to starting driving massive amounts of traffic to this page and begin collecting the contact information of those expressing interest. If you are unfamiliar with the process of generating traffic, one option is to outsource traffic generation to a company specializing in business opportunity traffic campaigns. Do it right and you&#8217;ll have plenty of leads for you and your team. Unfortunately, you will be incurring lead generation costs and you can expect to need to produce leads continuously.

### Attraction Marketing

In other words, seek to stop selling and start presenting people with valuable content they can use right here, right now. Establish a win-win relationship first. Then gently guide them to a presentation if it makes sense for them.
