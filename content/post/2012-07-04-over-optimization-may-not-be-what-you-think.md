Webmasters started to speculate what contributes to _over-optimization_ and the results were getting ridiculous. Some even said bolding a keyword is <u>over-optimization</u>, while it wasn&#8217;t.

Further into the same interview, Matt Cutts also explained that Google loves SEO. Comparing two sites, one with SEO and one without, Google prefers the SEOed site as it helps GoogleBot understand better. This is also the reason why Google is leveling the playing field, so genuine SEO works better while blackhat SEO gets punished.

Over-optimization does not happen easily. It is a condition that your website is having way way too much of SEO, not the legitimate ones, but those that is obvious to game the search engines. In other words, it is optimization beyond acceptable limit. Some of the red-flags to check for:

1. Keyword Stuffing

Keyword stuffing is when your website use too many keywords in their content. There is no clear threshold, but when your content contains too many keywords that&#8217;s beyond readable, you probably have too many keywords. A natural keyword density will be around 2% to 4%. Reason is, with keyword density of less than 2%, your content may not be focused enough on the topic. Keyword desity of more than 4%, the content will probably be hard to read. It&#8217;s not a rule to be within 2% to 4%, but most great content that ranks high and readable stays within 2% to 4% naturally. Try to keep your keyword density reasonable to prevent over-optimization.

2. Hidden Text

Hidden text is old, but we are still seeing people using this to game the search engines. Hidden text is some text which invisible to human eyes but included in the HTML source. Example is when the text color is the same as the page background. More advanced hidden text will be keyword stuffing in image-metas, JavaScript keyword stuffing and CSS stuffing. Google just recently announced that they are able to crawl JavaScript and Css now, so it&#8217;s time to rethink your strategy if you are blackhatting! This form of over-optimization will no longer go unnoticed!

3. Duplicate Content

If you copy and paste some paragraphs from other websites into yours, Google and other search engines would flag your content as duplicate and it can drop out your search result. This happens during the Panda update. Google is getting better and better at recognizing who&#8217;s original and who&#8217;s copycat, which is a good news to the thought leaders.

4. Cloaking Links or Links Spam

Cloaking links is a no-no since very long ago. Link spamming is also dangerous. Basically, any blackhat redirects or door-way pages are all frown upon. Other than this, also check the number of links on your site. If you have too many links pointing here and there just for the purpose of passing link juice that does not help visitor to navigate, remove those links. Google&#8217;s tracking visitor behavior and they know which link is necessary, which link is just redundant.
