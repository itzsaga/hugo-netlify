Let me begin first with the following idea that if you think of something and believe with conviction and desire it will come into fruition. Now there are all different ways to convey this message, however, the meaning never changes. Napoleon Hill said it best, “what the mind can conceive and believe it can achieve.” The questions become now,

  * What will indicate when you have reached your definition of success?
  * What will it feel like?
  * What will things taste like?
  * Will your lifestyle look the way you wish?
  * What smells will you associate with your success?

Everybody has their own definition, however, let me put this idea forward, success, regardless of the definition, is a path, not the end of a journey. I will say this again, “Success is a path not an end of a journey.” How does this equate to an MLM business opportunity?

### The MLM Business Opportunity Answer

All MLM business opportunity’s begin with a single individual having a dream and that dream is to sell a quality product, promote a brand, and lastly to build a down-line customer/promoter constituency. This will result in them becoming a successful business manager as well as earning multiple avenues of revenue through getting a percentage of the sale generated by those who join through their recruiting efforts.

One thing to consider when entering into any sales position, specifically new MLM business opportunities, is, are you willing to do whatever it takes, within reason, to work hard to achieve the goals set forth by the company as well as those you set for yourself? The trouble I have seen is not everyone believes in the product/brand. This is the biggest and hardest hurdle to overcome. This is because in order to become a good salesperson the person has to believe in the product, brand, or service. Otherwise, sadly enough, they are just spinning their wheels in mud and making a mess of their own lives.

### Looking to the Future with an MLM Business Opportunity

Let’s face facts not everybody is cut out to make a living as in sales, more importantly with an MLM business opportunity. It is a numbers game, the more people a salesperson connects with the greater chances they will have at making a sale. The next step is building a relationship with those people that buy. What this means is it is great to sell 100 widgets to new customers on a daily basis, it is even greater if they return to buy more.

This does not always occur and it is because the salesperson failed. It starts with rapport, which results in trust, which turns into a friendly bond because the salesperson can fulfill a need this is the beginning of a sale. What keeps them coming back is taking an interest in their lives and a continued effort to maintain and build trust through a commitment to ensure the customer’s satisfaction.

## The MLM Business Opportunity Success Formula

Anyone who tells you there is not a formula for being successful and any home based MLM business opportunity does not know what they are talking about. The formula is this: find a great product or service that you are passionate about that has a mlm business opportunity setup. Get that product or service in front of as many people who are interested as possible. Period. Where most lose is achieving this goal. They are told to call all their friends and family and then ask them to give them names and numbers of friends and family. Here is the problem with that, most of these people do not want to own their own business or be a part of a mlm business opportunity. So they may join but then fizzle out later or do nothing for the business. Generating unlimited laser targeted leads to show your [mlm business opportunity][1] to is the key to success and the number one system to do that is [Biz Builder University][1].
