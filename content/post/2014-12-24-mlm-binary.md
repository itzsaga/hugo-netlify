You have checked everything out and you believe you are nearly ready to start your MLM or internet marketing business; but when they were talking about compensation the phrase &#8220;MLM binary&#8221; came up and although you attempted to look smart you have no idea what it meant.

You&#8217;re not the only one. MLM compensation plans look as if they were created by mathematicsand seem to be exceptionally complex. Although on the surface they may look complex, if you sit down with somebody who knows about them they&#8217;re easy to work out.

## Here is What a MLM Binary Plan is

As we all know binary means 2.

So you just have to think of everything in pairs.

One of the first things that you will have to do when you commence building your new business is to signup 2 new folks who also need to enjoy the financial freedom of MLM selling.

You&#8217;ll sign these new people up and they become your front line. This is your private line of support and because this is a binary system they can then go out and recruit 2 more each.

No more. No less.

So now there&#8217;s 3 of you, you and two others. Let&#8217;s call them Mary and Jane. In the binary system Mary and Jane would go out and sponsor two others each, and theoretically everyone makes masses of cash and lives happily for ever. Sadly, many recruits will not do what they say they are going to do, and maybe Mary and Jane are lazy and don&#8217;t work very hard.

So you have to go find a few more folks and since you are only permitted to have a total of 2 people on your front link, you will have to put these new recruits UNDER either Mary or Jane.

Or perhaps you will place one under Mary and the other under Jane. Either way.

### MLM Binary Spillover

When you dropped your new recruits into the downlines of Jane and Mary, they received upline spillover.

To paraphrase, you have helped them build one side of their business based totally on your work. And this is one of the great benefits of the [MLM binary][1] compensation plan &#8211; the idea that, if you have an active upline, they would essentially aid you in building 1/2 your business.

You don&#8217;t stop there, you still need to continue to sponsor and recruit lots of people. You do this to keep balancing the two legs of the plan with the right people because most plans only pay a commission when the product volumes balance.

You can enjoy lots of spillover, but you will only be compensated when you keep adding new folk.

So this is one of the first points you have to understand. It&#8217;s not an issue of whether MLM binary is best for you but the important question is how are you able to promote your business effectively? You have to have a plan in place to push your opportunity and your production.

What sort of budget do you have for advertising and selling?

Have you thought about employing a lead generation system, which by the utilizing of attraction marketing should help explode your business.

How will you persuade people you are the upline leader they are looking for to help them reach their dreams and goals?

These are the most vital questions, truly, because if any person has made money through a MLM binary program, and many have, then it&#8217;s not the comp plan that is in question. The question is, what will you do to build your business?
