You might think a lead is a lead, but you are wrong. Creating a cold lead and a highly focused lead costs the same, but the latter is definitely much better. For instance, if the leads being generated aren&#8217;t correctly qualified during the process of promoting, the company will have wasted time and money on disinterested and unqualified clients. The advertising response number plummets, and the organization&#8217;s cash decreases, which is a pattern that can eventually produce disastrous results.

Lead generation is going to be something you have to do every day and you have to learn how to generate quality leads efficiently. Offline you will spend many hours meeting prospects and driving from and to appointments and making calls. If one of your methods of prospecting is gathering information thru forms and fliers, all this information has to be interpreted and transcribed into a database. Further information in the form of leaflets has to be mailed and then there&#8217;s the qualifying process that must be gone through, adding more expense and time. Back office staff in the sales department then has to process the lead to hopefully a successful closing. This is not an efficient lead management process.

### Online Lead Generation Process

Creating leads online is no less complex and labor-intensive, and if you have operated a web MLM business for any period you are probably nodding in harmony. You have an audience of millions when you market online, but that means that the qualifying process in your lead generation process is more crucial and it&#8217;s much more hard because few folks actually know you from a hole in the ground.

Any business takes time and money to get off the ground, the more money you can invest in your business, obviously, the more you can spend on hiring folks to do the time intensive jobs, or to do the things you can&#8217;t do. You can spend money on advertising which should bring in more leads.

If a person has created a interesting website and he or she is following the tried and true techniques of success, for example making an investment in an auto responder, promptly answering e-mails, adding articles on a consistent basis, prominently displaying an opt-in box, building backlinks and joining social media networks, they should be earning and if not, it is time to troubleshoot the lead generation process.

If you&#8217;re like 97% of all web marketers at this point, you&#8217;ll possibly be thinking of giving up and going back to the world of offline selling.

You were good at it. But there aren&#8217;t any roles! The people in line before you are individuals who are more qualified than you are!

You could scrape up some money. Then you could buy some leads. You&#8217;d be better off buying groceries. Which firms are you able to trust will be the first question, as the better the leads are the more costly they are going to be, and just one conversion will be one costly loss-producing lead. You have just spent the last of your cash and now you cannot buy any product to push!

What you want is a trustworthy lead generation process that works, one that is simple to learn and one that keeps you in charge of the entire process. A true lead management tool.

Your lead starts with you and ends with you when you close a deal. You want a system that teaches you the latest techniques of grabbing those targeted and qualified leads, and will keep you current on the newest, innovative methods for getting you through the lead generation process easily, leaving you with more time to build and enhance your business.

## The Best Lead Generation Process?

There is one system out there that had truly revolutionized the lead generation process online and is the only system that I can recommend in good conscience. [My Lead System Pro][1] is the #1 system on the internet. They have been around since 2008 and continue to innovate with new and more powerful tools. Start using the [lead generation process][2] that six and seven figure earners do now.

To your continued successes,
