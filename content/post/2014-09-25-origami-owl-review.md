Most MLM companies like to boast about how they have one of the best compensation packages in the business. An honest Origami Owl review has to mention that they run somewhere at the top as far as payouts go.

In the midst of arranging your first home party, they call a jewelry bar the facilitator keeps the profits right out of the gate. Just like any other MLM there is room to grow a team to increase sales and profit.
