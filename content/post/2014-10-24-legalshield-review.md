An initial LegalShield review shows that it is a collection of law firms. What they do is provide families with legal aide that cannot otherwise afford to retain a law office because of the expense. If, for any reason, there is a need for representation in a legal matter this is a great program that is affordable through low monthly payments. In addition, the availability is in forty-nine states and in Canada, where LegalShield representation is present in four provinces.

If one does a LegalShield review of the membership plans that are offered they find that they cover identity theft, small business, and most types of personal concerns where legal aide is helpful. Naturally, these are things such as divorce, real estate, and traffic violations. Furthermore, the plans cover monitoring and reporting credit along with an analysis of your credit and help with restoring credit should a theft occur that damages a good rating. As for where small business is concerned, anything pertaining to common questions, to aid in putting together a viable business plan that covers all legal issues with starting a business.

### LegalShield Review: The Way it Works

Once you become a member, a local law office will contact you to check for any immediate need for representation. If there is then this is the time to discuss the issues along with probable outcomes should there be a need to move forward. If a member is married and has a family with children under the age of eighteen all are covered under one plan. The plan additionally covers children of any age that may be challenged in any manner. Furthermore, if the need for a defensive trial lawyer arises the coverage is limited to the member and or spouse depending on which state the member resides.

LegalShield is as good as having a great life insurance policy that covers everything under the sun. You never know when or if you will ever have the need to contact a lawyer. This is what makes LegalShield advantageous because you have a prepaid attorney. It is through the affordability they provide with their partnerships with local law offices all over the country, and in Canada, which are monitored for reliability and responsiveness to their members. This way LegalShield ensures the quality of their service is second to none.
