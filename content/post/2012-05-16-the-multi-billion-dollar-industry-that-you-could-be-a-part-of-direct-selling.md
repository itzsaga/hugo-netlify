That’s the power of **Direct Selling**. Finding a company that has already done the heavy lifting and opened up your business into international markets could be the key to making money while you sleep. According to _Direct Selling_ News: “In all, the global <u>direct selling</u> industry is sized at over US$132 billion in estimated retail sales, generated by over 87 million individual direct sellers around the world. Asia Pacific is by far the largest region for direct selling in the world, followed by North America. Latin America and Europe/Africa make up the final regions accounted for in the report. Recent research shows that individual direct sellers in 21 countries in the world generate 90 percent of the world’s direct retail sales. Each of these countries generates in excess of $1 billion in direct sales per year.”

Harness yourself to one of the most powerful and fastest growing industries in the world. Direct Selling/Network Marketing. The results are in on this industry that has created more millionaires than any other industry in the world. Likewise, it could be said that it has also created more failures. That is why it is important that when you are looking at a company to represent, make sure that they have systems in place and the training support of current top producing income earners that you can access. Of course, find a product or service that you can stand behind and that has mass appeal. Once you’ve found the company that’s right for you, jump on board and make sure to take massive action and lock your place in the growing Direct Sales economy.
