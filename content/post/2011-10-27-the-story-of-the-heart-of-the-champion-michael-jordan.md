&#8220;I&#8217;ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career&#8230;

I&#8217;ve lost almost 300 games&#8230;

26 times I&#8217;ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed&#8230;

I&#8217;ve failed over and over and over again in my life&#8230;

And that is why I succeed.&#8221;

Who said it?

The legendary icon himself, **Michael Jordan**.

Thats what I&#8217;m looking for. A champion. A heart of pure gold, of pure desire. That&#8217;s what it takes.

You WILL fail in network marketing over and over and over again, there is absolutely no doubt about that and no way around it.

It takes that one final game winning shot to make it over the hump&#8230;and over that hump is everything you&#8217;ve ever wanted in life.
