<a rel="nofollow" href="http://sethaalexander.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Seriluna-logo-large.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-246" title="Seriluna" src="http://sethaalexander.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Seriluna-logo-large.png" alt="seriluna" width="372" height="157" /></a><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.seriluna.com"><b>Seriluna</b></a> review&#8217;s are few and far between right now. So I offer mine. Stepping into the direct selling marketplace is _Seriluna_. Specializing in spa products and loungewear they sell their products at home parties and online. In this <u>Seriluna</u> review as I have not used any of their products (everything is made in the US which is something to note for some) I will concentrate on them as an opportunity for the network marketer.

This company is directly marketing and an opportunity for women. Just like Mary Kay and Avon the products offered are for a specific demographic and to sell these products effectively one must be able to personally use them and relate to their customers. I will not let my personal feelings about sex specific companies affect my Seriluna review, however, I like companies that can be an opportunity to all. From what I understand there are  A LOT more women in the network marketing business so there is definitely a demand for companies that are centered around women.

There is not much available to go on which makes me weary of this new company. To have a truly accurate Seriluna review I feel that I should be able to describe and view their compensation plan and executives. Neither of these are available on their website. So from what I gather Independent Consultants buy one of two comprehensive stater kits for $99.00 or $199.00. These kits contain full-size product samples, brochures, order forms, and promotional materials. Independent Consultants also receive a persoanlly branded website which is free for the frist three months then $10.00 per month afterwards. There are no inventory management requirements and Consultants are not required to pay credit card fees. Compensation is a 30%-40% commission paid on personal sales and &#8220;residual income as your team flourishes.&#8221; In addition, &#8220;Fast Start Bonuses are an incentive to jumpstart your earnings right away!&#8221; whatever that means.

Overall I cannot bash on them in my Seriluna review. Do I think it&#8217;s a company worth looking into if the products seem like something you can be passionate about and think you can sell, yes. Would I like to know more before joining this company, yes as well. Especially about the residual income and seeing who is actually behind this company. It will be interesting to see if Seriluna turns into a big player or if they just pop and fizzle out. Either way, I hope my Seriluna review has helped you in your decision as to if you want to join this new company.
