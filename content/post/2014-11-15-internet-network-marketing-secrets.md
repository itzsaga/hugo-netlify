There&#8217;s a very blurred line nowadays between internet marketing and network marketing, but essentially all the techniques utilized for one may be employed to promote the other on the internet.

Internet network marketing can be promoting a product through forums, a site, or using social marketing sites and blogs. The only difference between internet marketing and network marketing is that network marketers are on the lookout for the chance to hire down-line members of their team as well as promoting their products.

If you have learned to promote a product successfully, then people will be clamoring to join your team, because they see how well you do and want a piece of the action too.

If you promote Amazon products by building your own internet sites and blogs, what would be the advantage of turning into a multilevel marketer?

This is one of many internet network marketing secrets, once you have hired numerous team members who are also successful, they will be earning profits for you as well. It will not take much effort on your part to earn the extra commissions.

Imagine having a successful downline team of maybe a couple of thousand folks, who were all happy and earnings serious incomes themselves &#8211; now you can see when you&#8217;re earning commissions from their sales, how much more successful you can become. With affiliate marketing you make a little on each and every sale that you make, and then need to wait for the following sale to come along &#8211; everything you do is by your own hand. With network marketing all those other folks are earning for you, even while you&#8217;re at the beach!

Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re employed 10 hours per week at your network marketing business, and you bring on board 20 folk who also work ten hours each week, this means that you have leveraged an extra two hundred hours every week, this is one of the internet network marketing secrets to success.

### Internet Network Marketing Secrets and Earnings Opportunities

There are people who earn their living doing network marketing and internet marketing at the same time, but if they find they are reaching success at network marketing they soon realize they are working a lot a less hours to earn the bulk of their income. Why is this? Internet marketing means continually monitoring all the new releases that come onto the market daily, researching, finding key words, making articles and getting back links to all of these sites. Many people outsource this task, but it can be hard to find good writers and not have to continually monitor them, making sure they return things on schedule, and obviously that also costs money and time.

I know one guy that has over 500 sites promoting affiliate products, some of these sites only produce one or two dollars a day. He does make an excellent living but boy what a lot of hard work!
