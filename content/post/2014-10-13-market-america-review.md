With around 200,000 active distributors globally you can see Market America Incorporated is a good company to join. With over $1 billion of retail commissions paid in the past, distributors have been paid over $2 billion in commissions over the lifed of the business. Naturally, it doesn&#8217;t mean that everyone who joins the company reaches success. As with any network marketing opportunity, what you get out of your business is the same as what you put in. So those few negative reviews that you do encounter online from failed Market America distributors, you can give no notice to.

Like most network marketing opportunities, Market America Inc has a minimum monthly product purchase requirement in place to qualify your business to accumulate and receive commissions.

To get a full share, you have to purchase 200BV worth of the product. BV or Business Volume is roughly eighty percent for every wholesale dollar you spend. You can make commissions on all retail product sold and also a commission for BV accumulated by you and your team.

The compensation plan is what&#8217;s ordinarily called a binary plan where you build one team divided up into two parts. You earn commissions when certain volume needs are met.

### Are you Prepared to Fully commit to Running your own Business?

Market America Incorporated is definitely a legit a successful company who offer evergreen products, with a straightforward compensatory plan with worldwide distribution. The proviso is that although this company&#8217;s opportunity may look ideal for you and your folks, there are particular things you have to understand.

Any potential sponsor is going to tell you that their opportunity is the best, but the reality is that in order to build a successful and profitable network marketing business you&#8217;ve got to present your products and opportunity to hundreds of folk, every day, every week and each year.

Neither the company nor you can stay in business if product sits on the shelf. These products have to be marketed to prospective customers. Nobody is going to buy the product or join your opportunity if you do not go out and market your business. Many a Market America review does not include this fact because they do not want to say that being in business is hard and turn away potential new partners.

So what are your plans for advertising, marketing and promotion? Once you&#8217;ve run out of friends, family and colleagues to market and introduce the product to, what are you going to do later? Do you know anything about marketing or sales? Have you any idea how you would effectively market the company-replicated site? Do you really know anything about driving pre-qualified and future clients to an internet website? These are all sides of any network marketing business that you must address, even after doing a Market America review and although it may look like the best opportunity for beginning your network marketing business.
