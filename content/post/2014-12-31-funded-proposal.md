Trying to get the cash together for any business is usually a challenge. Then the biggest problem appears and that&#8217;s promoting.

Setting up a business is fairly straight forward. The part of selling can be much more expensive and challenging. All of the complications inherent in promoting can be removed by adopting the funded proposal idea.

The whole idea behind selling is to promote your business, attract potential clients, and convert those leads into sales.

This is often an exceedingly slow and involved process where the outcome is usually unpredictable.

Due to that many companies run into financial difficulties before they are making any profits from their promotional efforts.

Many of us have discovered that funded proposals will take them a step further than the standard training utilized by most network marketing firms.

### The Idea of a Funded Proposal

The idea is that a marketer sign ups as many other potential network marketers as they can and takes them through a thorough training program. This helps them set up their business so these folks are added to his or her team.

The largest difference between this and the traditional system is that the new network marketing expert who is hired must pay a small fee for their coaching. The recruiter then uses those fees to cover any funding gap that comes by a slow-moving product or during their first advertising efforts.

By charging this fee, you get the leverage to resume coaching as many folk as possible who will ultimately turn into great movers and shakers. All without having to spend any of your own cash when you&#8217;re unsure of any results in the future.

Under such a setup, you stand to gain no matter what.

This is thanks to the fact that the new hire may or may not make any sales in the future. Your work may have been futile but you do not have to depend on the money she or he should make in the future right now.

This is thanks to the fact that the moneys they have paid for training will take care of the present as you wait for more prospects.

It is this that gave birth to the funded proposal. It has been demonstrated to be a successful technique as it takes care of its own expenses as it grows.

It is however important to ensure that the amount you charge is not too much for the new recruits. This can turn people off and jeopardize your activities.

As much as this option works really well at the initial stages, great product info is vital. Also, making sure that you&#8217;ve got the right applicants who can convert the coaching into potential leads and probably sales is the only sure way of growing.

It is calculated that many individuals who see the light after your training in many cases will grow into good promoters. These promoters will have bigger sales to sustain the business, therefore the great success of the MLM [funded proposal][1].
