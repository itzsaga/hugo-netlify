If you know of one of the longest established MLM businesses named Mary Kay, back when that company started there wasn&#8217;t any Internet, everything was conducted on a face to face basis. Distributors would ask people into their houses, hold makeup demonstrations, most likely have one or two cups of wine making the whole process a very social and private affair.

With the arrival of internet network marketing business &#8211; the business has, on the face of it, become much less private.

That explains why people are basically failing at network marketing. Even though it is definitely possible to reach thousands of people on the internet, not just a few like old style network marketing, new and unskilled network marketing promoters simply do not understand the whole concept of good old school marketing. People do not know how to network market like they used to.

They have never dealt with people in an one-to-one sales situation &#8211; in a couple words &#8211; they do not understand the whole idea of attraction marketing.

But it&#8217;s so straightforward! It means if you like me, you buy from me. That&#8217;s how Mary Kay and Pampered Chef have stayed in the business so long, along with the many other successful MLM businesses. I know you&#8217;ve seen those pink Cadillacs driven by loaded looking women, they did not get those Cadillacs by selling two lipsticks!

### So how does attraction work with a internet network marketing business?

The concept behind attraction marketing is to help people. People are on the Internet searching for information. They are looking for this information because they need something or have a problem. The Internet has made an incredibly educated purchasing public, they&#8217;ll research everything before they purchase anything by going on social media sites, posing questions in forums, reading articles and finding acceptable internet sites.

This is exactly the way your business must be, you have to be where those potential customers are. It does not mean going on Twitter and posting &#8220;buy my product&#8221; every 10 minutes. You have got to gain peoples trust by proving that you are an expert, and you truly would like to help the person answer their problem. That&#8217;s how online attraction marketing works for a internet network marketing business.

If you are new to the internet network marketing business, there are lots of places you can market. After you get one or two sales under your belt you can look into PPC advertising and advertising on Facebook &#8211; but not yet .

You need to get a system in place and stick to it. Everyone needs a system in this business and a strong will to achieve success.
