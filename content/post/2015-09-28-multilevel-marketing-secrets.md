The general idea is if you find anybody producing a result you want then all you need to do is find out precisely what that person is doing, copy them, and you have a great chance of producing the same result yourself &#8211; if you put in the effort and time needed to make it happen.

It&#8217;s the idea of multilevel modeling and, if you think about it, that&#8217;s precisely the type of result you want to produce in your network marketing business.

You would like people to duplicate you and your success so you will enjoy even greater success independent of your effort and time.

Put simply, you truly can find the &#8220;multilevel marketing secrets&#8221; these top producers are using, copy them, and fairly expect enjoying a similar result.

How are they promoting their web site pages, videos and coaching materials? Are they writing articles, doing webinars, sending out video emails?

What techniques are they using to get targeted traffic to their websites? Are they ranking organically in the search engines, and how many back links are they generating? Where is the majority of the traffic coming from? Are they using paid advertising, for example Google AdWords, or are they advertising on social media sites? How are they determining what sort of content to provide and which tools are they using to produce and promote the content? These are all multilevel marketing secrets of internet marketers and they can be uncovered through careful research.

### How to find these Multilevel Marketing Secrets

What do they do after making a post? Do they e-mail their subscribers or promote the new content or driving back links to it? Why do they produce two minute videos versus 10 minute videos? Do they outsource the majority of their work or not?

As fast as you find out their &#8220;secrets to success&#8221; all you&#8217;ve got to do is take similar action.
