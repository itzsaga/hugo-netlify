In the beginning of network marketing and MLM very often people had to attend trade shows, hotel meetings, and get themselves in front of hundreds of people regularly, or worse, cold call. If you&#8217;re a friendly, honest person people would warm to you and buy whatever it was you were selling.

Online today there is renascence in attraction marketing and one of the simplest and most popular techniques of doing this is through video.

YouTube gets millions of visitors daily. If somebody is interested in a product, they will search for it and watch a video. If you have made a video about that product, they may click through and get it from you. You took some time to review the product and were rewarded.

If you want to be a top marketeer on the web today, there&#8217;s no easier way than video.

## An Attraction Marketing System Means Selling Yourself

When I&#8217;m asked how does attraction marketing work this is what I tell people. The basis of a attraction marketing system is selling yourself. You set yourself up as very experienced and knowledgeable about your product. You can go about attraction marketing in many ways, you can write useful reviews, talk about your product on a blog, build a site about it or advertise your product using YouTube &#8211; in any of these strategies you are showing your character and expertise.

People will then begin to relate to you and if they like who they see they will trust you and be more inclined to buy something from you, because they like you. This is what a attraction marketing system comes down to, getting people to like you.

One serious mistake that people make these days is when they write articles. It is one of the first things that are outsourced by internet marketers and fairly often the resulting articles aren&#8217;t superb. Sadly many of these who outsource their article writing don&#8217;t even trouble to check the work and post it regardless, losing the reader after the first couple of lines. If you are going to outsource article writing in your attraction marketing system I suggest you use <a href="http://www.odesk.com" target="_blank">odesk</a> or <a href="http://www.elance.com" target="_blank">elance</a> and find someone who truly knows what they are doing. This is not cheap but the results are much better.

If you select products that you believe in and are are excited about, this will reflect in the articles you write. These articles should be written in a conversational and friendly manner. Your visitors will understand your enthusiasm through your writing. They will appreciate that you know what you&#8217;re talking about and have researched everything and again that enhances trust.

### The Use of Multimedia in an Attraction Marketing System

Writing good articles is just one side of attraction marketing. Video is much better &#8211; you can&#8217;t hire someone in the Philippines to do that for you!

By making a video you are branding yourself right away. Successful marketing is dependent on attraction marketing and you&#8217;ll see that the most successful marketing pros use video as a lucrative platform for promoting their businesses.

The web is the place everyone goes these days to research a product they have an interest in buying.

These researchers, after they have finally made up their minds to buy are warm consumers, pre-sold on a product.

If your site is one of the last ones they see and is helpful, educational, and amicable with fair product reviews, they are more likely to purchase from you.

### Secrets of the Attraction Marketing System Revealed

Imagine working less than an hour every day to attract 10-20 new leads per day&#8230;

Or more. Imagine personally sponsoring 10-15 new team members per month without ever harassing your family or friends or making a cold call to tire-kicker.

Imagine eventually embracing a proven attraction marketing system that is sure to produce results when you have it set up.
