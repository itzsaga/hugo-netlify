### Why Building a Prospecting System is Critical

Social marketing or MLM not only pays you for the products that you can sell, but you also make a percentage from sales that your downline team makes, unlike affiliate marketing where only you can make sales, and thus your commissions are limited.

So now you not only do you get paid on personal sales, you also earn an income on the sales of everyone on your team.

So while you might be able to produce only a few hundred dollars of sales a month, your team might be in a position to produce thousands, even hundreds of thousands of bucks in volume which produces a pleasant, highly leveraged passive income.

It&#8217;s a very simple idea, the more people you have in your downline, the more cash you can make. The great thing about social marketing is that you are leveraging other people&#8217;s time and benefit financially from having a big team, so ultimately your time is used more wisely sponsoring and hiring people rather than selling the product. So if you do your MLM recruiting on autopilot your life will be easier.

### MLM Prospecting Systems Defined

It is generally recommended that in social marketing you spend at least 80% of your time bringing in or sponsoring other people into your opportunity, this is the only way to make large amounts of money from multilevel selling. Serious incomes can be earned in MLM by having an enormous and successful downline, who in turn will induct and sponsor other teams below them.

So what&#8217;s are MLM prospecting systems exactly? It is a system of reaching out and connecting with folk who might be interested in learning more about your opportunity, directing them to a straightforward presentation, then following up to collect a sale. It is prospecting for network marketing.

Are you in or are you out? That&#8217;s it. That is what all MLM prospecting systems are in short.

There is not any right or wrong way to build a moneymaking MLM business.

There are seven-figure income earners who have built their businesses by approaching only family, buddies, work-mates and associates.

There are people who have built awesome businesses by hosting little home meetings and in meeting rooms. Others have purchased universal business proposition leads and qualify them by telephone.

Many run advertisements. Some concentrate on attracting patrons and potential team managers on the web.

The only thing that makes one of these MLM prospecting systems successful, if you consider it, is the one which works best for you. If you can diversify and use a mixture of different techniques then that will guarantee your success.

Do you know plenty of folks? Are you good at public presenting? If standing in front of 1000 people scares you to death, then you probably should not do it.

Do you like picking up the phone and talking to people who have voiced an interest in starting their own network marketing business? You may like going thru leads and speaking on the telephone, you might even be one of the rare folk who really enjoys cold calling!

If you detest doing this, like the majority, then you will quickly stop prospecting and quit, so do not do it.

If you are willing to spend the time building a website, driving traffic and waiting a little time for results, then internet marketing is perhaps your calling. There are no get rich quick schemes here. There are tons of MLM prospecting systems that can be found online that may help you in generating qualified leads, and which can produce much-needed cash flow, regardless of whether they join your opportunity this is the same as putting your business on autopilot.
