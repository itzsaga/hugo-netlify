But the crux of the matter is your internet site needs to be found, and this is where SEO is important.

Before starting you could have selected a considerable number of keywords pertaining to the products that you&#8217;re going to be promoting. So when a person searches for &#8220;pink fuzzy slippers&#8221; your website will ideally be on the front page of the search results.

So how on earth do you get your network marketing internet site onto the 1st page of the SERPs? There are numerous ways that you can go about this, and it involves finding places where you can advertise your network marketing business for free. By promoting actively online and off-line, and making your site search engine friendly:

  * Participate on social media sites such as Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube and Twitter.
  * Become an active participator in forums related to your products or service.
  * Write lots of articles. Those articles should be providing beneficial info to people who are searching for your particular product.

## Using Social Media for Free Network Marketing Advertising

YouTube gets billions of hits a week, Facebook has over 1,000,000,000 active users, right there is a goldmine, but only if you use them in the right way. Social media sites could make or break a business and thousands have failed just because they don&#8217;t know the way to go about social media marketing correctly. Of course, you might pay for advertising on Facebook, but it is only effective if you&#8217;re already a recognized business, and most small companies blow their advertising budgets in a few days with few results.

Another way to expose your business is on Twitter, but there&#8217;s already a large amount of noise on there from inexperienced users. Don&#8217;t be one of them and get ignored because you&#8217;re branded as a bother. Again you have got to find out how to use this medium in the correct way.

YouTube makes some people thousands of bucks. This is a great way to do free network marketing advertising.

Get over being camera shy, and don&#8217;t say you can&#8217;t afford the hardware or software. Better to put part of your promotion budget into purchasing the equipment, than spend money on PPC advertising.

YouTube is the fastest way of branding you and your product. This is because YouTube is owned by Google.

Don&#8217;t say you can not afford to get a WebCam, software or mic because they are dirt cheap nowadays. You can even get free movie making software online or from Microsoft. It&#8217;s better than blowing your money on some useless Facebook advertising campaign. YouTube gets your face out to millions and is an effective and efficient way of self branding.

Good forums are excellent places to give good information and find answers too. You can get ideas for videos and articles simply by seeing which questions are asked most often.
