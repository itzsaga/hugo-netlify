**Motivation** drives everything we do in life. We also all have our own _motivation_ in business. We started working in the direct selling industry with the goal of being money AND time free. To truly achieve this one must have the right <u>motivation</u> as well as the right skills and training. My motivation came into my life initially on February, 29th of this year when I saw my future child for the first time during an ultrasound. I have definitely seen more success in all aspects of my life as I prepare to bring this child into the world. My motivation has turned from wanting to be financially stable so I can have fun to being financially stable and working on the internet so I can spend every waking moment with my son.

I truly believe if the only reason you are in network marketing is to make massive residual income you are in the wrong industry. This not only is a selling business but a people business. Straighten your motivation up! You should want to make others succeed. That is our main objective. If you succeed, I succeed. This is our business.

I digress. I&#8217;m talking about motivation. Find yours. Whatever it is. Are you part of the 99% of network marketers who have never earned a penny? Why do you think that is? Your motivation must not be right. If properly motivated you will do whatever it takes to make sure you reach your goals. NOTHING will stand in your way. I have seen more business success with my network marketing businesses in the past 6 months since I got motivated then in the prior two years combined.

If you need help with your motivation I am here for you. I am a real person with a real life. Not only do I want to build business relationships but I want to build friendships with those I work with. I also suggest you get on the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sethalexander.weeklymarketingwebinars.com/">Weekly Webinars</a>. Not only are these amazing training but by signing for free you get added to my personal list. So take some time, sit down and really think about what your motivation is in business. Or even in life. I have definitely found mine. Enjoy the video of our future son&#8217;s gender reveal party.
