There is a basic change in how people think when they make the turn from a negative to positive mentality. Have you made that change yet?

On a daily basis people are contacting me looking for help with making their business successful. They have a great product, a passion for what they do, yet can not seem to make things move forward no matter what they do. A lot of these people have also put themselves into a great amount of debt and in doing such created a state of misery in their life. They have decided that the network marketing industry does not work. That internet marketing is impossible. That the only thing left to do is give up and be stuck in a cubicle for the rest of their life making someone else rich while they do basic tasks over and over again. This is the mentality that they are living with.

If this sounds like you then you MUST read this entire post or you will be doomed in your business due to your mentality&#8230;

Like all things in life if what you are doing over and over and over again to try and achieve a goal is not working then there is only one solution, STOP! Now is the time to shift your mentality. It is 100% possible to do and I have to force myself to do it almost daily. Eventually, the shift will be permanent and the conscious effort for a mentality change will have transformed you into who you want to be.

Think about your business tactics carefully. Think about your overall business mentality when it comes to what you have done and the results you have achieved. What worked last month in your marketing tactics has changed by this month (sometimes it takes longer but things ALWAYS change). There are limited resources and as we learn to use them effectively we are essentially watering down the value of those resources and must continue to learn new ways to do the same things.

So stop what you are doing right now. It&#8217;s Friday. Take the weekend off from your business. We got into this business to be time and money free right? Not to be bound and tied down by what we do. Relax and recharge. Only do the things that make you happy. Start refreshing your mentality. If you have been failing I guarantee you it is NOT your fault if you are truly trying your hardest. Take the time to realize this and start fresh on Monday. Shift your mentality to the positive.

Go ahead and turn off your computer for the weekend. Turn off e-mail notifications on your smart phone. Disconnect. We all need it from time to time. Life is not about work. Remember that. Ingrain that into your mentality. That you are living and working to have a life of experiences and memories.

I&#8217;ll see you on the flip. I&#8217;m going to enjoy this weekend and all the experiences that come with it to continue to refresh my mentality.
