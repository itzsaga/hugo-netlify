Recently Google has decided that they are moving into the Knowledge Graph arena. What this means is Google is working to provide &#8220;real-world&#8221; answers to searchers &#8220;real-world&#8221; questions. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.freebase.com"><em>Freebase</em></a> is where Google is getting the data to build it&#8217;s Knowledge Graph. The best part is, YOU can put your info into it and it&#8217;s FREE! It&#8217;s like a wiki site basically.

**What is Freebase?**

<u>Freebase</u> is a database owned by Google of topics and entities that are associated with real people, things, etc. Freebase is 100% open-source so anyone can add to it.

The basic element in Freebase is a topic. As an example, there are multiple topics with the title &#8220;William Shakespeare&#8221; (one is about the 1950&#8217;s singer, one is about the famous poet, etc.). Each topic in Freebase is assigned a unique ID.

These topics can then be grouped into bases. Think a YouTube channel and you get the idea of what a base is. One could create a base named &#8220;English Literature&#8221; and add to it Agatha Christie, William Shakespeare, or other related topics. Inside bases, a person can also a thing called &#8220;views&#8221; which are kind of like playlists.<!--more-->

Freebase also has an aspect they call schemas. A schema boils down to a form that one enters data into. Because of these shcemas, the info in Freebase gets automatically cataloged and organized so that Google can easily use it for it&#8217;s Knowledge Graph and other purposes.

**How-to add your business to Freebase**

First, create a Freebase account. You can also login with a Google or Yahoo! account.

Second, check to see if your business is already in Freebase. This is a Google project so don&#8217;t be surprised if it is. Search using the bar on the top left &#8220;_Find topics&#8230;_&#8220;

If your business is not listed make sure you&#8217;re at Freebase.com and navigate to the category you&#8217;re going to list your business in. Don&#8217;t worry if you fall into multiple categories, you can add more later.

Then find the subcategory which Freebase calls types.

For this how-to we&#8217;re going to use Business then Employer as the example.

Now you&#8217;ll see a list of topics in the category (type). To add your business click the _Add More Topics_ button.

Now type in your business name. Near the end of the drop down box choose _Create New Employer_, then click _Save_. Now the new topic is added to _Employer_ type.

Now, click on the name of the topic you just created. You&#8217;ll be taken to the topic in view mode. To edit your topic, click _Edit this topic_ on the right side of the page.

Now that you&#8217;re in edit mode, you can enter the employer information in a form (schema) specifically designed for this purpose.

Now, as stated earlier, you can add more types (also known as categories) to each topic. To add more types, simply click the  _Add a type_ button located next to the Types section.

Every new type will produce a form (aka schema) that you will fill with information.

In addition, you can create your own custom types in Freebase. To do this, go to your user profile, then edit the _My types_ section located on the right.

You can also add aliases to the topic, this is exactly what it says, an alternative name for it. These are there just in case someone looks up your business with a slightly different name or misspells its name.

Within the topic section on the right, you can mention websites associated with the topic, add images to the gallery or start a discussion.

If you have a Wikipedia page be sure to add it to this list.

**Lastly&#8230;**

Even though Google said that they are using Freebase to supply the Knowledge Graph with data. A lot of people have seen that if one has a strong Google Plus (or Google+ Local) profile, the information from it will often come up in the Knowledge Graph.

**Conclusion**

Google themselves have stated it, they are moving away from being solely about webpages and want to be more about real-world things. Through this shift many marketers are trying to figure out how to better present their information to Google.

According to Matt Cutts (head of webspam at Google), an important part of the change is being in Google&#8217;s Knowledge Graph and social media on the whole. Seeing as Google&#8217;s Freebase is a very important source of Google&#8217;s Knowledge Graph data you better make sure as a digital marketer to look into it and gain extra exposure for your web businesses.
