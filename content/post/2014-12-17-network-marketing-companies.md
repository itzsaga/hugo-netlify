  * Avon
  * Amway
  * Pampered Chef
  * Melaleuca
  * USANA
  * Mary Kay
  * NuSkin

These are a few really successful network marketing or multilevel marketing companies who have been in business for a number of years.

Numerous others have come and gone before them. There are approximately 80 network marketing companies that are going strong today.

Taking a look at this network marketing companies list should give you an idea about the products that work in the M.L.M. model. If you&#8217;re thinking about joining an MLM or network marketing opportunity you&#8217;ll see what these companies sell are referred to as &#8220;Evergreen&#8221; products. These are products that were in demand when the company started, and will continue to be in demand in fifty years time.

If you have seen an MLM opportunity you&#8217;re thinking about joining but their products don&#8217;t fall under this &#8220;evergreen&#8221; heading, you should think carefully about joining. Things that are favored today can become quickly outdated.

Multi-Level Marketing actually doesn&#8217;t work best outside of these sorts of products, and if the company goes tits up so does your business.

### Three Top Network Marketing Companies

Taking as an example three of the network marketing companies mentioned above, this is why they&#8217;re such a success:

**Amway**

Amway has sales higher than $8 billion dollars annually and is famous for its energizing sales meetings.

They sell over 450 products that cover everything from household cleaners to vitamins. Again, stuff that folks will always need. The strange thing about Amway is that a distributor doesn&#8217;t have to purchase products for inventory when they join, and when they leave the company will buy back any inventory they&#8217;re holding.

Hard to see why anybody would want to leave!

**Pampered Chef**

Pampered chef sells prime quality kitchen devices and tools through seventy thousand independent consultants.

They do popular cooking demonstrations and the firm has raised over $7 million to help to fight world hunger.

Most individuals will always need cookery-ware!

**Mary Kay**

When you say network marketing, most people will think of Mary Kay first. This company goes from strength to strength and has been around since the early 1960s. Again their reps&#8217; in home beauty sessions are not only fun and educational, but part of successful attraction marketing.
