Something that the super successful have realized is contained in this video featuring Aimee Mullins. Aimee is a record breaking Paralympic athlete. Challenges are just opportunities for you to find the strength and courage in yourself to conquer them.

When you have learned how to turn all your challenges, tests, and obstacles into opportunities to improve and progress your life a unique shift happens. You go from having a negative mindset about things to seeing how everything can better you in the end. You see challenges as a way of achieving greatness.

So take a listen to Aimee today. I promise it is worth it.
