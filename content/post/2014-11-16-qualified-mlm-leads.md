It is pretty simple to obtain a current email and a phone number from an individual. However, when someone inquires directly about your multi level marketing business, most likely this person is extremely interested. These who inquire directly are qualified MLM leads.

Be suspicious of any company that tries to convince you that the leads they&#8217;d like to sell you are qualified, you should ask, &#8220;Qualified by whom?&#8221;

Get your own qualified MLM leads, to be sure they&#8217;re not recycled, stale or unimportant.

### Your Own Qualified MLM Leads are Best

By generating your own qualified MLM leads you have already started a connection with the names on your list.

Maybe you have answered their questions thru email, thru your blog or thru website. Maybe you have met the person face to face. You can&#8217;t leave these qualified MLM leads on the back burner for too much time, people who are excited to get into an MLM opportunity are consistently being approached by others.

If you have a blog or website, discover as much as you can about search engine optimization. This could drive people to your site which will opt in to receive further information about your opportunity.

By solidly writing optimized articles around actual key phrases, it&#8217;s possible to attract increased traffic, improve rankings in the search sites and as a result, generate a lot more pre qualified MLM leads.

Of course you can use a sponsored offer system, an example is [MLSP][1], with your network marketing business to add the additional advantage of bringing you a flow of income during the time you build your list and become established.

### Turn Your Customers into Associates

Promoting your service or product on your website will bring buyers and there&#8217;s nothing people like more these days than saving a couple of dollars. You could simply offer a discount for your best customers to assist in improving your profits and your downline. A lot of folks will register to simply get a discount on what they buy, but other individuals will discover the opportunity to promote the product or service and jump at the chance to make additional money. If they buy your product they already know all about it so they are going to enthusiastically promote it to anyone they know. These people are among the cheapest leads imaginable. They are also highly targeted marketing leads for you.

### Getting Email & Premium Qualified MLM Leads

Email can also be a great source of leads, even though it routinely requires up to 7 or so e-mails for the person to feel as if they trust you. Developing a video of yourself chatting about your product and adding it to one of your first emails to them can save time, and answer any doubts and concerns they might have. This is a key part of [internet network marketing][2]. Midweek is the best time to send emails as well as Sunday evening.

Premium leads are collected by a visitor to your website filling in a sign up form and these forms can ask for your prospect&#8217;s info as well as a phone number.

Remember a lot of these individuals are checking out a lot of other opportunities. So don&#8217;t let those well qualified MLM leads go someplace else and enroll in someone else&#8217;s opportunity, because you wasted a lot of time before speaking with them.
