Not only are they staying at home and avoiding the company rat race, they&#8217;re working the hours they want to and making thousands of dollars each month &#8211; living better than they ever did working for &#8220;The Man.&#8221;

### The Fundamentals about Network Marketing on the Internet

It&#8217;s of no consequence how old you are either, experienced older people who have been in sales all their life are happily bolstering their pension savings and annuities with network marketing on the internet.

I also come across many kids still in school making a great living from network marketing on the internet, paying their way through college and buying their own cars with the earnings.

Network marketing could be seen as being straightforward, that is if you know what you&#8217;re doing. Basically what you do need to know is how network marketing works on the Internet, and have a knowledge of why the successful people in the business are successful.

But if anyone tells you it is easy, they&#8217;re not telling you the entire truth.

Network marketing can be simple if you follow some very essential guidelines and do all the correct things but it can be hard work at the start, but isn&#8217;t any new job?

After laying a solid foundation and gaining comprehensive experience of network marketing you will be able to kick back and enjoy passive monthly earnings with little effort on your part.

There&#8217;s nothing more thrilling than finding deposits in your PayPal account when you wake up in the morning, or checks in your mail box.

If you get onto the internet and search for info about internet network marketing secrets you will be certain to come across some folks, the so-called [internet marketing gurus][1] who will try and sell you stuff.

As soon as you show an interest you will be hit with a &#8216;squeeze page &#8216; that offers you all sorts of other courses and strategies, and the worst is they are saying you will &#8220;never see this offer again at the price&#8221;, or some such hype.

Yes these guys do make lots of money, but they only care about themselves &#8211; they do nothing to help you, their technique is to draw in lazy or stupid people who think that they can make seven-figure incomes in a matter of months without doing any work! There are people in the network marketing business who do offer extremely useful information with some in the form of courses, but at this stage you won&#8217;t know who they may be, so don&#8217;t fork over cash for anything yet.

The best folk you will find are willing to share their information for free and help you.

## Network Marketing on the Internet Coaches

A good [internet marketing mentor][2] is someone who is already successful at network marketing, making the results that you want to achieve eventually. They can also tell you that internet marketing is all about building relationships, and these methodologies take a large amount of time to develop and a certain quantity of talent to carry out. This is a genuine business.

This is certainly not a get rich quick opportunity.

And although it has everything to do with becoming skilled at sales and marketing, it is not a matter of selling&#8230; It is a matter of teaching and display.

Show and tell. Not sell, sell, sell. That&#8217;s the way to internet network marketing success.
