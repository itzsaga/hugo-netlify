Basically what the theory stands for is the fact that if you can see yourself as it, then you can be it. It means that you are clearly in control of your own destiny and it is all about what you give to world as to what the world gives you in return. You will find that there are four basic steps to the law of _attraction_.

First, you have to decide what it is that your heart desires and then ask the universe (or yourself). Secondly, you need to work on yourself from the inside out so that you can be a positive person and release your negative energy, positivity breeds <u>attraction</u>. Then you have to act like you deserve it and like you already have what it is that your heart desires. You will find that the final step will come natural and it is where you will need to allow yourself to be open to receive it. That is the basics of the law of attraction; however, you need to figure out how you can apply it in the work environment.

The thing is that you can use the law of attraction to do anything. You can use it as a way for you to find your way at work, get a promotion, connect with your co-workers, market your business, and so on. You can use attraction for any aspect of your career or life. However, you need to keep in mind that the energy that you have and the energy that you receive has to be positive. You can&#8217;t allow some of the negativity to get to you and you can&#8217;t allow yourself to be blackballed. You will need to learn to find your comfortable medium at work.

You will also notice that the law of attraction can also help motivate you to reach your personal career goals. You will notice that the third step means that you need to take control of your career direction and act like you have already achieved your goals. This will give you a taste of what it would be like if you were successful in meeting your goals, and that will work as strong motivation. You will find that it will also help you to block the negative energy too. This will not only make you have a stronger presence at work, but it will make your personality stronger in general. You will have encouragement, empowerment, and even freedom from all the negative feelings and thoughts that you may have about yourself. You will possess all the attributes to cause attraction to you.

In general, you will find that the law of attraction will help you to become a better person. You will also find that it will make you feel completely different. For instance, you may feel a little bit stronger when you walk into a silenced room and you will also get other people to notice you more (that is the attraction working). You will become a strong presence and that will make a difference in the way that your boss perceives you. You will want to keep in mind that there are a lot of ways that you can benefit from trying to use the theory in other aspects of your life and not just in your career. People who live their life by the theory tend to grow stronger, but they also tend to find their true happiness.

It is easy to talk about the law of attraction. However, putting it into practice and using attraction marketing I believe takes training for most people. I do truly believe that attraction marketing is the number one form of marketing that there is on the internet. One of the best courses available is <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sethalexander.magneticsponsoringonline.com/">Mike Dillard&#8217;s Magnetic Sponsoring</a>. Not only is the initial seven video course **FREE** but the content provided is amazing when it comes to laying the groundwork for a successful attraction marketing plan.
