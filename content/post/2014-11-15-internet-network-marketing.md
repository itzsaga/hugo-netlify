Internet marketing covers lots of different kinds of selling, whether or not it is from an internet site, via social media, blogs, forums, or Squidoo lenses. This is what makes it attractive for [network marketing online][1].

Network marketing is the means not only of selling, but hiring others to sell for you, and this can be achieved by using any of the strategies above also. Thru the internet we will be able to show our businesses and products to millions of men and women. Gone are the days of hassling pals and family to join our network or purchase our product!

### Video with Internet Network Marketing

One of the most effective platforms on the internet today both for internet marketing and network marketing purposes is video. If you take a quick look around you to you will see loads of people promoting products, a lot of them making thousands a month online. There&#8217;s no-one who is successful in either style of marketing nowadays that doesn&#8217;t make promotional videos. Find a video on YouTube which has thousands of hits, and see what techniques they&#8217;re using to make those successful videos.

Videos are sent in e-mails, they are posted on blogs and they&#8217;re always used during promotions and on an internet site. Folks love videos, reading after all takes a certain amount of effort!

The other thing about video is that you can get your face in front of thousands of people. It&#8217;s all just a part of attraction marketing which is proving to be the most powerful way of promoting on the internet, especially with internet network marketing.

### Lights! Action!

Many folks hate cameras and I&#8217;m one of them. For whatever reason although I record a video privately the chance of masses of people seeing me in a video scares me to death. I will have to get over it. There&#8217;s no tricky technology involved nowadays &#8211; everything is plug and play. All that you need is a good computer, a camera and a microphone, some quickly downloaded software and you have the potential to make good videos. I have seen WebCams on Amazon.com for less than $10, Windows Movie Maker comes free on many new computers. Many laptops now have built in cameras that will produce high quality videos for internet network marketing.

If you get scared don&#8217;t worry. Just do a few takes and utilize a script then choose the one you like best. If you hate the way you look make it a goal to earn enough to get a hair transplant or a face lift. If you look on YouTube there are some real ugly people on there and they&#8217;re making great money doing internet network marketing!

If your first couple of videos are terrible, even to the point of funny, post them anyway, this is all part of attraction marketing and if folk see you are the same as them, they will warm up to you.

It will not take long before you are making perfect small videos every day, but please keep them short.

Everyone&#8217;s in a hurry nowadays so don&#8217;t take an hour to say what could actually be said in 5 minutes or you&#8217;ll bore folks to death.

The really frightening thing is, your video could possibly be seen by millions of people. So smile for the camera, you know they love it, and take a little time to brush up on the words you use, as some words are more effective in sales scenarios than others. Using video is only one of the tools that you are going to use to push your product and your business, but when you have learned how to push your video and get it to rank on search websites and get traffic to your website, tons of leads and sales, you&#8217;ll never put the camera down.
