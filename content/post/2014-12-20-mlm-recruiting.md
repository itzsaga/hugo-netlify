You must do the same if you wish to get financial freedom. Recruiting and sponsoring. Here&#8217;s where all heavy hitters make their money. And that is it in a nutshell.

Think about it.

You might represent the best vitamin, service or technical advancement in the history of mankind &#8211; but if you spend all of your time promoting the product and getting new clients, don&#8217;t you really just have a glorified commission-only sales job?

Now, instead if you focus on recruiting to your MLM opportunity and training your new people to sell your product effectively, now do you see there will be lots of people doing what you were doing, and your business will be growing quicker because of them.

On your own you may only be able to sell 100 units of the product in a single month. But once you have a well-trained and effective team you could be selling thousands of units each month!

### MLM Recruiting It&#8217;s a Numbers Game

Take a close, hard look at the business of any internet marketing six-figure or perhaps seven-figure earner and you may be stunned to discover almost all of their cash is made of the efforts of less than a half a dozen top producers.

Not hundreds. A few. And, chances are, they didn&#8217;t personally even sponsor or hire these heavy hitters.

The great majority of folk in social marketing quickly lose interest in their enterprises, or just do not make it. Only 30 percent who sign up will actually last past the first 3 months. Who can say why? Perhaps folks are lazy. But it is a sad fact. Only 3 percent out of this 30 percent will become the ones who make 6 and 7 figure incomes.

The others may do particularly well and just make a couple of thousand dollars a month, many individuals are quite happy doing that.

Those 3 percent will become the heavy hitter megastars. So if you are considering internet promotion think about that, how are you going to personally find the time and the most effective strategy to recruit and sponsor at least one hundred new team members knowing full well that only 30 will stick around.

It&#8217;s a numbers game like anything in business, the action to take is to anticipate and ensure that your MLM recruiting is getting that tiny percentage who will make you lots of revenue.

## Increasing Your MLM Recruiting Success

To personally sponsor a hundred new team members you want present your network marketing opportunity to well over a thousand possible team members.

Maybe more. So you need to figure out a way to create a good flow of new prospects to take a look at your business.

Any idea how you are going to make this occur?

While there&#8217;s no wrong or right way to do MLM recruiting &#8211; you&#8217;ll need to go through the numbers because it&#8217;s a sifting and sorting process, not a convincing and selling process.

You need to get a way to hook up with a large number of folks on an everyday basis, direct them to a simple display, and follow up with those who have expressed an interest.

One of the swiftest and simplest ways of [MLM recruiting][1] is by using an internet [MLM lead generation system][2]. You could almost call it MLM recruiting on autopilot, you set it up, you promote the system and then the system attracts those people who are looking to change their lives. You are left to concentrate on other aspects of your business.

Of course, if you have set aside a budget for promoting and advertising, you might need to start running advertisements online and most likely off-line too. You may also discuss putting together an advertising co-op with your downline members and splitting the costs and the ensuing leads. Find what works for you and keep at it. If you&#8217;re just starting out you want to find those hundred recruits. So start now, decide what MLM recruiting will work for you and keep working on it.
