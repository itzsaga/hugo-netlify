If you are considering social marketing or an MLM business to supplement your revenue be aware that the hardest part of building an MLM business is knowing how to generate leads online, and lots of them. Only about 5% of social marketers ever get to grips with hot to generate leads online. If you need to be successful don&#8217;t be like all of the others.

You have to use a proven system to generate leads online which will also include certain other systems which may help you. Even if you do start your business cold calling, you want a system for recording and tracking all of those calls. When you make the call, who you talked with, the person&#8217;s e-mail address, and the prospect&#8217;s answer.

After a month of writing everything down on bits of paper you are going to end up with a mess. Even if you only come away from a call with the prospect&#8217;s name and email address that&#8217;s a superb start. Building an e-mail list is the simplest way to start building a business.

Figure out who your best target will be before you even pick up the phone. People are busy and they&#8217;re certainly not going to waste their time chatting with you about something that is not related to their business. Always remember that time is money, so spending your days contacting the wrong folk is an expensive mistake.

Come up with an original selling message after you&#8217;ve learned everything you can about the product you&#8217;re promoting. Nobody has the time to hear a load of BS and they will quickly smell that BS even over the phone!

If you start off well and get into a discussion with a prospect, but then you&#8217;re unable to answer one of his questions, tell him you will get back to him later with the answer. People appreciate and respect the truth. The same principle applies if you generate leads online. You have to keep it real and keep the BS down to a minimum.

It&#8217;s easy to brand yourself and your product on the Web but you want to get out there. Off-line there are some cheap ways of making yourself visible too.

You might become a member of an association or a club where folks in related businesses gather.

## Generate Leads Online in Groups

Online you can find the same kind of places where folks gather &#8211; social media sites such as Facebook. This is a great spot to generate leads online. On Facebook there are thousands of Groups. Join some Groups related to your product or business, find out what the group&#8217;s members are talking about and what problems they are having and help.

Don&#8217;t join a Group and start pitching your product immediately. Show people you are an expert and it will not be long before they start asking you what you do. Don&#8217;t ever give anybody the idea that you are frantic to make a sale.

When you make a sale &#8211; ask for a referral! You have formed a relationship with your consumer and you have solved their problem. So don&#8217;t be embarrassed or feel awkward asking if they know anybody else you can help.

The best way to generate leads is through word of mouth referrals.

If you are in an company that sells computer hardware, start to meet people who sell computer software. You can build some extraordinarily worthwhile networks like that, and the leads will be highly qualified.

### Generate Leads Online With Your Website

Always refer people to your website. Make sure it is kept up to date and is full of handy info for them. After you build your email list you can use an auto-responder service to send regular e-mails to your customers telling them about recent stories in your industry. Make it useful and full of information but don&#8217;t make it too long. Do not word it so it&#8217;s obvious you want to make a sale.

You must get people interested with a killer title and quickly lead them down to a call to action, such as &#8220;if you&#8217;d like more information&#8221; which should be at the end of your short e-mail. If the recipient does click through via that call to action, you can be certain that this is a highly qualified lead.
