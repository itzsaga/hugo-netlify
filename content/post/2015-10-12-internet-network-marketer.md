Free leads on demand, daily product sales and new team member sign ups.

But there are some challenges as well&#8230;

Even before looking for a product there are several things that you have to know before it&#8217;s possible to become a successful internet network marketer.

You are in the business to make sales &#8211; plain and simple. If you know zip about the psychology of selling, then there are many things you need to learn. One of the best ways to learn the psychology of selling is to read [Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion][1].

The words &#8220;selling&#8221; and &#8220;sales&#8221; seem to be taboo these days, but that&#8217;s what you need to not only learn&#8230; But master&#8230; If you have any hope of becoming a profitable internet network marketer.

Sales are part of selling and selling is unquestionably the name of the game these days. That&#8217;s a fact for the internet network marketer.

There&#8217;s a lot of psychology behind selling and systems that have to be employed to make sales. You have to get your prospect to feel, after he has made his purchase, that he got something he wanted at a fantastic price. Even before that you have to use your talents as an internet network marketer to make your web site or blog or online videos **POP** with an offer that cannot be ignored.

But there is a fine balance because people hate to be &#8220;sold.&#8221; They want to feel in control throughout the entire buying process. Most sales are made rashly for emotional reasons, and once somebody has made a decision to purchase something, they regularly go on to justify their acquisition. As a salesman you need to lead them by the hand and delicately steer them toward that sale.

## Internet Network Marketer Selling Strategies

When planning your internet site a good trick is to have a decoy offer.

Say for example you are marketing a natural lotion.

If you offer one bottle of the lotion at an inflated price people will think it&#8217;s not a fair deal, but if you offer a buy 2 get 1 free deal next to it for just a little more, they can perceive that as being a far better deal and purchase the 2 as an alternative.

Clients have a hard time making their minds up, so you mustn&#8217;t offer too many choices, different colors being a good example. If people get confused by too many decisions they may simply depart without buying anything. The most noteworthy internet network marketers will offer up to 3 options or selections. This is applicable to anything concerning prospects joining your opportunity. Try and make the highest priced package deal the most enticing for your new team members, but don&#8217;t offer more than three options.

If someone says no to something, they will continue to say no. The key&#8217;s to find a technique to get him saying yes.

You need to discover what their objection is. Are they saying no to the size, the name, the color or the price? If you can remove that factor then they are going to stop saying no.

That old saying you get what you pay for is true. If you price your product way lower than your competitor&#8217;s product folks are going to think there&#8217;s something&#8217;s wrong with it. Low prices are very often compared with low-quality, so don&#8217;t price anything too cost-effectively. This is a common mistake of a new internet network marketer.

### Scarcity as a Internet Network Marketer

Give people the assumption that they are special and you do not just sell your products to any Tom, Dick or Harry. When people are told they can&#8217;t have something, like kids, they&#8217;ll try even harder to get it. It&#8217;s very often the item that has sold sign on it that people want the most. You can turn this strange psychology upside down to your advantage.

Scarcity is an excellent tool &#8211; just look at the hysteria folks get into over a certain toy every holiday season. The kid wants what he most likely can&#8217;t get and mom or pop pay a premium for it. So announcing there&#8217;s a limited number of a product can get people buying right away. On the subject of limited offers, never say something is limited and then continue to supply it after the cut-off point. People will think that you were being untruthful, or the product itself has something wrong with it so they won&#8217;t purchase it.

These are several things that you should keep in mind if you&#8217;d like to be a successful internet network marketer. Of course, in network marketing the key to your success will be massive lead generation. You will need a steady stream of new prospects in order to promote your products and opportunity.
