Living in the network marketing industry is very rewarding, especially with the compensation you are given for your efforts. With your commissions coming in for your own work and also the your downline helping you to earn even more.

Your downline is simply the people you have invited to join you in your business. They work for you as a team under your leadership. If you truly want to make massive income in network marketing, building a team is the ideal way. However, not everyone naturally has the **leadership skills** needed to make them not only effective but a competent leader. Lucky for you and all leader these days there are many ways to develop your _leadership skills_ without hurting your small starting budget.

There are many free webinars available online that will help show you how to be a leader. These webinars will show you the basic concepts as well as the principles of leadership.

Some of these webinars will charge a small fee, however, if you wait patiently and are diligent in your looking, you will find many that are free. Even if a webinar is charging a small fee, in the end you will get more than you paid in information and knowledge if you truly did find a good leader. The small fee is more than worth it to develop your <u>leadership skills</u>.<!--more-->

Research is also a key tool to use if you want to improve your leadership skills without having to spend that much money. Many articles and blog posts (like this one) are published online filled with useful tips to help you in your leadership life. There are also many books in regards to leadership that would be great additions to your business library. With everything going digital never forget that there are free resources in libraries and for centuries that is how the world worked. Many great leader developed their leadership skills strictly through reading books.

Now leadership is not just theory, you have to look into how to actually apply the principles and concepts you are learning. To do this attending workshops and seminars on leadership and team-building will help you not only understand but how to use your leadership skills when you are working with your team. Overall they usually do not cost much and will more than give you your money&#8217;s worth in experience.

Who said developing your leadership skills should be expensive? There are a lot of inexpensive ways to bring out the leader in you, and you should try them all out!
