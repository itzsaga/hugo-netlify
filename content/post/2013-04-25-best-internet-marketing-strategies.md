This is a complex and confusing question for most. Internet marketing is a complex and continually evolving discipline. In addition, the people who hold the keys, such as Google, never completely clue in the public as to how they work. This causes constant debate on what the best internet marketing strategies are.

Every type of internet marketing has its own pros and cons. Also, every strategy can be adapted to the stage of internet marketing knowledge a person has. Some popular and often debates best internet marketing strategies are:

  * Email Marketing
  * Online PR
  * Link Building
  * Organic Search
  * Analytics
  * Paid Search
  * Social Networks
  * Affiliate Marketing
  * Pay Per Click

This is by no means an exhaustive list but a good representation of what is out there. I know when I first started marketing online I suffered from what has been dubbed &#8220;shiny object syndrome&#8221; and &#8220;information overload&#8221;. A lot of people do. I wanted to be the best at everything so I could make the most money using a ton of different strategies at the same time. The thing is, it&#8217;s hard to be the best at everything. I ended up being mediocre at a lot of things. It took me a long time to realize that I needed to master one strategy. Be earning consistently and what I wanted from it then move on to the next.

## My Two Best Internet Marketing Strategies

Likewise, there is no way to know what will happen tomorrow with the internet. It is always changing. What Google or Bing thinks makes a link relevant today and has your site ranking high could change tomorrow. A keyword could become hyper competitive and your Pay Per Click marketing campaign may become to expensive to warrant continuing. There is one thing that is consistent though. That&#8217;s leads. Having a way to generate ten, fifty, one hundred laser targeted leads per day is an extremely powerful thing. It is the past, present, and future of internet marketing. If you want to have a sustainable business online you have to be constantly generating leads and converting those leads into sales. The [Biz Builder Academy][1] does just that. Something I wish I had when I was just starting out. This thing is dope. It&#8217;s so structured that if I had just followed along step by step I would have rocketed my internet marketing career when I started. I truly think it is one of the best internet marketing strategies available right now.

One of the hottest internet marketing tips and trends right now and what some consider to be the future if not right now of internet marketing is social sharing. That is, Facebook Likes and Share, Twitter Tweets, Google +1&#8217;s, Pinterest Pins, etc&#8230; Right now it looks like the best internet marketing strategies are all surrounding social networks and how they do two things. One, they spread the word of your product/service and thus bring in business. Two, every share is a backlink to your site thus increasing the ranking in the search engines. Now I truly believe having your own email list by generating leads is here to stay. However, being on the cusp of what is hot now will only help. This free 95 minute webinar on [The Future of Internet Marketing ][2] will show you everything you need to know about how to generate 2,500+ shares, retweets, comments, and likes on every piece of content you make. All on auto-pilot.

When it comes to what the best marketing strategy is there is no real winner. However, these are a few of the best internet marketing strategies in my opinion and trust me when I say I have tried a lot! Web marketing strategies will never be a 100% science, although, I think there are systems that can be followed that will greatly increase the rate of success a person has. The main one I **have to recommend** is the [Biz Builder Academy][1]. It truly is that good.
