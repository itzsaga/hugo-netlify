<a href="http://sethaalexander.com/faster-site-loads-cloudflare/layout-1/" rel="attachment wp-att-1274"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1274" alt="cloudflare" src="http://sethaalexander.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/CF_Final_Pos-300x151.jpg" width="300" height="151" /></a>So from now on this site should load A LOT faster thanks to CloudFlare. Like 60%+ faster and that&#8217;s just right now. I recently started using CloudFlare and I highly suggest them to anyone who runs a website. I also have been optimizing and changing some options around in the backend. If you noticed that I haven&#8217;t posted for a while it&#8217;s partly because of this. My server was compromised and some malicious code was injected into my sites. I had to backup and completely rebuild the site from scratch.

One positive of this is that I had the chance to remove some and install some things better than the first time. I have learned a lot since I originally put this site online and now you should benefit from it. Be on the lookout for another product launch coming soon as well as a lot more blog posts as I delve into the world or article marketing.

Take this as a short CloudFlare review and remember the best part, [CloudFlare][1] is free for a single site account!
