I know the willingness to work is out there, but wealth cannot be reached without proper instruction. I&#8217;m here to help save you the money I lost in my journey and help you reach the goals you set when you joined this industry.

On this site right here, you will find a wide variety of content, information, tips, and tricks when it comes to online marketing, social media, entrepreneurship, and many other topics. These are things that I am passionate about and have personal experience with.

If you have questions contact me anytime and I will help you.

### **_SETH ALEXANDER&#8217;S PERSONAL STORY_**

I&#8217;m a born and bred New Yorker that moved to the South. I am an entrepreneur, biohacker, wine enthusiast, internet marketer, network marketer, Mensa member, web developer, and hospitality professional. I also like to read real books, the kind made out of paper.

Following the normal network marketing path never made sense to me. My &#8220;warm market&#8221; were not the rock stars I wanted to build a business with. They were my friends. I realized that to truly dominate in the network marketing game I had to leverage my time better. I could achieve this through the power of the internet. So I set out to find the answer and copy what the top names in this industry are doing.

I finally found some answers and started learning from top income earners who built their entire business without leaving their homes and in their spare time. This is what I wanted. I started to build myself. I started to build the brand of Seth Alexander. I&#8217;m mastering one avenue at a time and having fun doing it. Isn&#8217;t that what this industry is about? Being money AND time free? Not replacing a full time job for another full time job.

So stick around. Subscribe. Do some reading. I bet you&#8217;ll learn something.
